<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The aim of the compiler of this work has simply
been to point out and give information respecting
some of the ways by which women may earn a
living in the present day, especial regard being had
to the wants of the immense number of ladies who
have to depend upon their own exertions for their
support. It is confidently believed that the information
given will be found substantially correct, as
in most cases it has been overlooked and corrected
by the different authorities from whom it was derived.
Of course, in a book of this size it would be
manifestly impossible, even if it were desirable, to
describe all the different occupations which in various
ranks of life are open to women.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />

<small>INTRODUCTORY.</small></h2>


<p>One of the most pressing social problems of the day is
how the immense number of women&mdash;greatly outnumbering
the men&mdash;in England at the present time
are to be supported. The obvious answer is, that
they must be taught and encouraged to support themselves.
This little book is written in the hope of
directing their attention to some suitable and remunerative
employments that are not universally known,
and it is also hoped it may prove useful to parents
who are anxious to arm their daughters for the battle
of life with a weapon no one can take from them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"When land is gone, and money spent,</div>
  <div class="verse">Then learning is most excellent."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And a thorough knowledge of some remunerative employment
would do more to make them independent
of "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
than the possession of any amount of money, especially
in these days of bank failures and general
depression of trade.</p>

<p>The great difficulty ladies usually find in securing
congenial and sufficiently well-paid employment arises
from the pressing necessity they are generally under
of earning money at once, which prevents them giving
the necessary time to learn whatever calling they may
wish to adopt. I have endeavoured to ascertain as
exactly as possible the time required to learn all the
occupations I mention, as well as the cost of tuition,
and, in most cases, I subjoin the rules, or give extracts
from the prospectuses of the different schools
and classes where ladies may receive the necessary
instruction, thinking it may help many to decide
upon what they are most fitted for, and what they can
best afford to undertake. I have also collected as much
information as I could for those whose circumstances
make it essential that they should at once receive
remuneration for their work; but I must remind them
that generally what is worth having is worth waiting
and working for, and they must not expect to be as
well paid as their more fortunate sisters, who are able
to give time and money to learn a business thoroughly.
The superficiality of girls' education is very much
against them when it becomes a question of how they
are to earn their living. If they were taught even one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
thing thoroughly they would probably be able to turn
it to account; or at least they would have acquired
the habit of learning accurately, which is all important,
and one which, I am sorry to say, most women
are sadly deficient in. Industry, determination, accuracy,
and perseverance, would, I am certain, be quite
sufficient to overcome almost all the difficulties women
at present find in supporting themselves. For those
who do not possess or who will not earnestly endeavour
to acquire these qualities, I fear this book will
be of little service. I have had to listen to bitter
complaints of the careless way in which ladies execute
work that is entrusted to them, of their want of punctuality
and business habits, and their ineradicable conviction
that they are conferring a favour upon their
employers by working for them at all. All this sort of
thing naturally makes large employers of female labour
reluctant to try ladies, if they can get sufficient work-girls,
who, whatever their faults may be, are at least
free from the affectation and conceit of some of their
superiors in the social scale. Why do not ladies make
up their minds to remove this reproach from their
class by giving a good day's work for a good day's
wage? I heartily wish all women would decide once
and for ever to give up the notion that it is humiliating
or degrading to work for payment; to my mind
the only shame in the matter is in the cases where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
full value is not given for the money received, when
of course it becomes more or less an affair of charity.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that girls are brought up to
think that the only way in which they can dispose of
themselves that will give satisfaction to their friends
is to get married, and if from various causes they fail
to achieve this end they will be looked upon more or
less as social failures. Although I am perfectly willing
to admit that a happy marriage is the best fate that
can befall a woman, surely an unhappy one is one of
the worst; and how many of these would be prevented
if women only had something else to do and think
about, some other means of advancing themselves in
life!</p>

<p>I wish parents could be induced to treat their
daughters more in the way they treat their sons&mdash;that
is to say, when they leave school have them thoroughly
trained for some profession; it would be much better
for them, and many of the difficulties of the "woman
question" would disappear, as the untrained women
of middle age who have suddenly to depend upon
their own exertions are those for whom it is almost
impossible to provide any suitable occupation, especially
if they object or are unfit to become hospital
nurses, and have not sufficient capacity for arithmetic
to learn book-keeping. I must refer any of my readers
who want personal advice as to their qualifications for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
different occupations to the Society for Promoting the
Employment of Women, 22, Berners Street, Oxford
Street, W. Miss King, the Secretary, or Miss Lewin,
the Under Secretary, are both able and willing to give
advice and reliable information; no fee of any kind is
charged. This excellent society has been in existence
twenty years; during the whole time a free register
has been kept, by means of which many hundreds of
women have obtained situations or temporary employment.
Visits from applicants average about ten daily,
and the office has been a centre for the collecting and
diffusion of information on all subjects bearing on the
employment of women; while many whose names are
never entered on the register are put in the way of
procuring training or employment, and are warned
against persons who, by alluring promises of easy ladylike
employment, tempt the unwary to spend their
slender means in lessons that are worthless.</p>

<p>With an income which, from all sources, including
subscriptions and donations for special purposes, has
only averaged £319 7s. 6d. per annum, it has trained
yearly on an average, thirty young women, obtained
regular employment for sixty-three, and occasional
employment for one hundred and forty-two.</p>

<p>I must take this opportunity of acknowledging
the great kindness I have met with during my search
for information while compiling the book. With one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
exception, I have everywhere been treated with the
greatest courtesy; all my questions have been most
fully answered, and every facility given me for
obtaining all the particulars I could possibly desire.</p>

<p>I find that, after common sense and business habits,
the qualification most likely to be useful to a woman
is a good knowledge of drawing; so I advise any one
who has any taste in that direction to sedulously
cultivate it.</p>

<p>I am much interested in a scheme for starting a
School of Tapestry, where ladies could be apprenticed,
and after they had acquired the art, work regularly, as
they do at the Royal School of Art Needlework.
There is nothing in the nature of the work to prevent
women doing it, although it is an occupation that
has long been monopolised by men. The necessary
apprenticeship would be at least two years.</p>

<p>A scheme has lately been set on foot for organising
classes for teaching girls who are anxious to obtain
engagements in superior houses of business, the regular
routine of office work, book-keeping, &amp;c. Inquiries
may be addressed to Miss Franks, 23, Mortimer
Street.</p>

<p>I wish I could convince women of a truth they
seem singularly slow in comprehending&mdash;that is, that if
they are to compete with men on anything like equal
terms, they must, at the very least, give the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
to learn their business that men find necessary. There
is always a demand for really skilled labour, and this
skill is worth almost any present sacrifice to obtain;
besides its pecuniary advantages, the knowledge that
one can do something really well (not in an amateur
fashion) confers a most gratifying sense of power and
independence. I do not agree with those people who
think it a hardship for women to have to work for
their living; on the contrary, I believe if an average
of happiness could be ascertained, it would be found
the toilers had a far larger share than the idlers, and
when trouble and disappointment come, as come they
will, they must remember that&mdash;</p>

<small>EDUCATION.</small></h2>


<p>After having made inquiries about a great variety
of female occupations, I have come to the conclusion
that teaching is still the most suitable, and, under
certain circumstances, the most remunerative, employment
open to women. But an ordinary education no
longer qualifies a woman for the position of governess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in any educational establishment; if she wishes to be
tolerably certain of securing an engagement it is
necessary that she should be certificated, or, still
better, have completed her education at Girton,
Newnham, or one of the new halls opened at Oxford,
and it is most desirable that she should pass the
new examination of teachers instituted by the
Teachers' Training Syndicate of Cambridge.</p>


<h3>TRAINING FOR MIDDLE AND HIGHER CLASS TEACHING.</h3>

<p><i>The Training College for Teachers in Middle and
Higher Schools</i> for girls (temporary address, Skinner
Street, Bishopsgate Street) trains ladies who have
completed their school education as teachers in middle
and higher schools for girls for this examination.</p>

<p>The Council have obtained as a Practising School,
the Bishopsgate Middle Class Girls' School. There
are two divisions in the college. The course is of
one year for students entering the upper division,
and two years for the lower division. The following
are the rules of this Institution:&mdash;</p>

<p>The college year is divided into three terms, each
of about thirteen weeks, beginning respectively in
the middle of September and January, and the beginning
of May. The hours of attendance are from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on every day but Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Fees, £8 per term, payable in advance.</p>

<p>No residence is provided for the students, but the
principal will be prepared to recommend homes to
those students who require them. Students must be
above the age of seventeen for the lower division, and
eighteen for the higher division, at the time of admission,
and must pass an entrance examination, unless
they have previously passed some examination
accepted in place of the entrance examination. The
examinations accepted by the Council in the place
of the entrance examination for the upper division
are those which the University of Cambridge
requires from candidates for the teachers' examination.</p>

<p>For further particulars respecting scholarships (of
which there are several), &amp;c., apply to the Principal
at the College.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>The Teachers' Training Syndicate of Cambridge</i>
issue the following scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. An Examination in the Theory, History, and
Practice of Teaching will be held at Cambridge, and
at other places if so determined by the Syndicate, in
June, for persons who have completed the age
of twenty before June 1st, and certificates will be
awarded to those who have passed the examination
satisfactorily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>II. No candidate can be admitted to the examination
unless he or she has either&mdash;(1.) Graduated
in some university of the United Kingdom; or (2.)
satisfied the examiners in Parts I. and II. of the
Previous Examination; or (3.) obtained a certificate in
one of the Higher Local Examinations of the Universities
of Oxford or Cambridge; or (4.) obtained the
certificates of the Oxford and Cambridge Schools
Examination Board in the subjects accepted by the
University as equivalent to Parts I. and II. of the
Previous Examination; or (5.) satisfied the examiners
in one of the Senior Local Examinations of the
Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, or Durham, in
English, and at least one language, ancient or modern,
and in Euclid and Algebra; or (6.) passed the examination
for matriculation at the University of London.</p>

<p>III. The subjects for examination will be&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The theory of education.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The scientific basis of the art of education;
characteristics of childhood and youth; order of development
and laws of growth, and operation of
mental faculties; natural order of the acquisition of
knowledge; development of the will; formation of
habits and of character; sympathy and its effects.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Elements of the art of education; training
of the senses, the memory, the imagination, and taste,
the powers of judging and reasoning; training of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
desires and of the will; discipline and authority;
emulation, its use and abuse; rewards and punishments.</p>

<p>(2.) The general history of education in Europe
since the revival of learning. A general knowledge
will be required of systems of education which have
actually existed, of the work of eminent teachers, and
of the theories of writers on education up to the
present time.</p>

<p>(3.) The practice of education. This subject will
consist of two parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Method; that is, the order and correlation of
studies, oral teaching and exposition, the right use of
text-books and note-books, the art of examining and
questioning, and the best methods of teaching the
various subjects which are included in the curriculum
of an ordinary school.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) School management. The structure, furniture,
and fitting of school-rooms, books and apparatus, visible
and tangible illustrations, classification, distribution of
time, registration of attendance and progress, hygiene,
with special reference to the material arrangements of
the school, and the conditions of healthful study. One
paper will be set on each of these subjects, 1, 2, 3.
A fourth paper will be set containing a small number
of questions of an advanced character on each of the
three subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>A fee of £2 10s. shall be paid to the Syndicate by
each candidate.</p>

<p>IV. The Syndicate will further award certificates
of practical efficiency in teaching to candidates who
have already obtained a certificate of theoretical efficiency
and have been engaged in school-work for a
year in some school or schools to be approved of by the
Syndicate. The basis for the certificate of practical
efficiency will be:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Examination of the class taught by the candidate;</p>

<p>(2.) An inspection of the class while being
taught;</p>

<p>(3.) Questions put to the teacher in private after
the inspection;</p>

<p>(4.) A report made by the head masters or mistresses;</p>

<p>(5.) The Syndicate will also be ready to inspect,
in the course of the summer, any college established
for the training of teachers other than elementary,
and to award certificates of theoretical knowledge to
such candidates as may deserve them. They will also
award certificates of practical efficiency if they are
satisfied with the training in practical work received
by the candidates.</p>

<p>I understand that the Senate of the University
of London have also at present under consideration a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
scheme for the examination of teachers. The Home
and Colonial School Society, Gray's Inn Road, King's
Cross, London, also gives instruction in the art of
teaching. Their terms to resident students between
the ages of 15 and 30 are from £45 to £50 per
annum; to day students £15 per annum, £8 for six
months. Teachers are also trained and prepared for
the Cambridge Teachers Examination at the West-Central
Collegiate School, 29, Queen's Square, Bloomsbury,
for a year; the fee is £5 5s., but in the case of
any one who could be really useful in teaching in the
school no charge would be made.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Girton College, Cambridge.</i>&mdash;The course for the
ordinary degree certificate occupies about three years,
half of each year being spent in college. For honours
the time allowed is somewhat longer. The academical
year is divided into three terms, the charge for
board, lodging, and instruction is £35 per term, paid
in advance. This sum covers the whole of the college
charges. Candidates for admission are required to
pass an entrance examination, unless they have previously
passed one of the examinations approved by
the college authorities, and to furnish a satisfactory
certificate of character. For students intending to
read for the ordinary degree certificate, October is the
best time for entering. Candidates for honours may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
with advantage enter in April, thus gaining an additional
term. Except in special cases students are not
received under the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>Entrance examinations are held in London in
March and June; a fee of £1 is charged.</p>

<p>There are several scholarships attached to the
college, of which full particulars can be obtained,
together with forms of entry, and copies of the programme
and of former entrance examinations, on application
to the Secretary, Miss Kensington, 22,
Gloucester Place, Hyde Park, London, W. The
committee wish it to be understood that although
residence for three years is necessary for obtaining a
certificate, students can be received for shorter periods.</p>

<p>Arrangements are made for holding examinations
of the students of the college, and certifying proficiency.
A certificate called a degree certificate is conferred
upon any student whose proficiency has been certified
to the satisfaction of the college, according to the
standard of any examinations qualifying for the B.A.
degree of the University of Cambridge, if such student
has fulfilled, so far as in the judgment of the college
was practicable, all the conditions imposed for the
time being by the university on candidates for degrees.</p>

<p>A certificate called a college certificate will be
conferred upon any student who shall have passed, to
the satisfaction of the college, examinations similar in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
subjects and standard to those qualifying for the B.A.
degree of the University of Cambridge, the following
deviations being permitted: The substitution of
French and English, or German and English, for
Latin or for Greek; the substitution of English,
French, and German for both Latin and Greek; the
omission, in case of objection, of the theological part
of the examination.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Newnham Hall.</i>&mdash;No student is admitted under
the age of eighteen. Students are required to give references
satisfactory to the principal, and no student
is permitted to come into residence without the approval
of the principal.</p>

<p>The principal may require any student to withdraw
who in her opinion is not profiting by the
course of study at Cambridge. The charges for board
and lodging and tuition are 25 guineas a term, and
15s. a year is charged for the use of the gymnasium.
Unless under special circumstances, students who intend
to pass the Cambridge Higher Local Examination
will be required to pass in English history, English literature,
and arithmetic, before coming into residence.
Those who have taken honours in the Cambridge
Senior Local Examination will be exempt from this
rule.</p>

<p>The academic year, from October to June, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
divided into three terms, corresponding to the terms of
the Cambridge University.</p>

<p>The public lectures of thirty of the university
professors are now open to women, and the permission
to attend the lectures of the professors of natural
science include the privilege of gaining access to
some of the natural science museums and laboratories.</p>

<p>Ladies can be received as out-students of the
College; they must either be women living with their
parents at Cambridge, or <i>bonâ fide</i> students over thirty
years of age, or otherwise in exceptional circumstances.
The tuition fee for out-students is 6 guineas a term.</p>

<p>Students of limited means, especially those preparing
for the profession of teaching, may avail themselves
of the help granted from a loan fund towards the payment
of their fees for lectures and the purchase of
books.</p>

<p>Those who need this assistance should apply to
Mrs. Bateson, Secretary of the Association for Promoting
the Higher Education of Women, St. John's
Lodge, Cambridge. They must give some testimony
respecting their intellectual qualifications.</p>

<p>A certain number of exhibitions of 5 guineas a
term are awarded by the principal to students needing
assistance, regard being had to intellectual qualifications,
and a written statement of circumstances
being required. These exhibitions are tenable with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
scholarships, of which there are a considerable
number. The principal's name and address is Miss
A. J. Clough, Newnham Hall, Cambridge.</p>

<p>The students from Girton and Newnham who
have wished to become governesses have hitherto had
no difficulty whatever in obtaining engagements with
good salaries.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.</i>&mdash;The object of the
founders of this hall has been to procure for those
desirous of availing themselves of the Association
for Promoting the Higher Education of Women in
Oxford the protection and training of an academical
house on the principles of the Church of England, but
with provision for the liberty of members of other
religious bodies.</p>

<p>The charges of the hall will at first amount to £25
per term, or £75 per annum, for each student, exclusive
of expenses strictly personal. There are no entrance
fees, but the expenses of the term will be paid in
advance. The committee hope that as the hall grows
they may be able to reduce this charge. Sisters, or
other ladies willing to share the same room, will be
allowed a reduction of charge.</p>

<p>Provision will be made in certain cases, by exhibitions
or otherwise, for students whose resources are
insufficient for the expenses of the course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The terms will correspond generally with those of
the university. The fees for instruction will be paid
to the General Association, and are not included in
the charges of the hall. They will probably be about
£15 per annum. Each student will have a room to
herself, fitted up to serve as sitting-room and bed-room.
There will also be a common sitting-room, and
meals will be in common in the dining-room. Names
for entrance must be sent to the lady principal,
Miss Wordsworth, Riseholme, Lincoln.</p>

<p>Students are required to give references satisfactory
to the lady principal. In the case of those
who have been in any other place of education, a
letter of recommendation from its authorities will be
required. Those applying for admission must satisfy
the lady principal as to their character and attainments.</p>

<p>Students will not be allowed to reside for less
than an academical year without special leave.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Somerville Hall, Oxford.</i>&mdash;An association having
been formed in Oxford for promoting the higher education
of women, this hall is established for the reception
of students coming from a distance to attend the
lectures of the association. Care will be taken in the
conduct of it that members of different religious
denominations are placed on the same footing. The
life of the students will be modelled on that of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
English family. No student will be admitted under
the age of seventeen.</p>

<p>The ordinary charges for board and lodging will
be 20 guineas per term, paid in advance, or 60 guineas
for the whole year of three terms; the terms corresponding
generally to those of university residence.
The fees for instruction will probably be about 15
guineas a year.</p>

<p>Particulars concerning exhibitions and scholarships
may be learnt on application to the principal, Miss M.
Shaw Lefevre, whose London address is 41, Seymour
Street, W., or to either of the Secretaries&mdash;the Hon.
Mrs. Harcourt, Cowley Grange, Oxford; or Mrs. J. H.
Ward, 5, Bradmore Road, Oxford.</p>


<h3>KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS.</h3>

<p>The demand for trained Kindergarten teachers
is at present considerably in excess of the supply;
the average salary is £80 a year. These are the
rules of examination published by the Froebel
Society for the Promotion of the Kindergarten
System:&mdash;</p>

<p>Examinations of students of the Kindergarten
system are held in London, conducted by examiners
appointed by the committee of the Froebel Society.
Those students who satisfy the examiners will receive
first or second class certificates of their qualification to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
become Kindergarten teachers. No candidate will be
admitted to examination under the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>The whole examination need not be passed in one
year. A candidate may present herself for any
number of the groups, or for all; and when all have
been passed the candidate will receive a first or
second class certificate. All candidates will be expected
to produce a certificate of having passed some
recognised public examination in English subjects, as&mdash;Oxford
or Cambridge Senior Local, Higher Local;
Society of Arts; First and Second Class, College of
Preceptors; Government Elementary Teachers; &amp;c.
In special cases the production of a certificate may be
excused, provided the committee are satisfied that a
candidate has received a good general education. This
will not apply to the younger candidates. The fee for
the whole examination will be £1; for each group, if
taken separately, 3s. The fees will be returned if
through unavoidable circumstances the candidate cannot
present herself for examination. Candidates will
be expected to produce evidence that they have not
had less than six months' practice in class teaching of
young children, and to satisfy the examiners of their
ability to organise a Kindergarten. Names of candidates
must be sent to Mrs. E. Berry, hon. secretary
to the Froebel Society, 27, Upper Bedford
Place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>


<p class="sub"><i>Kindergarten Training College</i>, 31, Tavistock
Place.&mdash;The college is founded to provide a central
place of training for Kindergarten teachers who
intend to qualify for the Froebel Society's certificates.
The college is open to all students above
seventeen years of age, who are otherwise qualified to
enter for the Froebel Society's examination. The
course of instruction for regular students includes
all the subjects laid down from time to time in the
syllabus of the Froebel Society's examination, and is
divided into a first and second year's course.</p>

<p>Students must at the end of their first year
take such portions of the Froebel Society's examinations
as shall hereafter be indicated by the Council.
At the close of the second year students will be
expected to pass the examination for the full certificate.</p>

<p>All regular students are required to attend the
lectures and practical work of the college throughout
their first year of study.</p>

<p>During the second year, attendance at the college
in the morning is not obligatory for students who
have qualified as assistant teachers, provided that
the principal be satisfied that they have practice in
teaching under the direction of some persons approved
by the council of the college.</p>

<p>Therefore, all lectures and lessons connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
with the second year's course, other than lessons in
the Kindergarten, are given in the afternoon or
evening.</p>

<p>Afternoon or evening lessons and lectures are
open to students not being regular students of the
college, on certain conditions hereafter to be specified,
and at a special charge per course. A Kindergarten
is attached to the college.</p>

<p>The college year is divided into three terms, each
of about thirteen weeks. The hours of attendance
are from 9.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 4.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>; and on Saturdays
from 9.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 12.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Fees £20 per year, or £7 per term, payable in
advance. No residence is provided for students, but
the Council are prepared to recommend homes in
the neighbourhood of the college.</p>

<p>There is also a Kindergarten College and Practising
School at 21, Stockwell Road, London, belonging
to the British and Foreign School Society. The
course of instruction extends over two years, and
the fees are £10 10s. a year, with some trifling
extras. Secretary, Mr. Alfred Bourne, B.A. The
Home and Colonial School Society, Gray's Inn Road,
London, also has a Kindergarten Class for private
governesses, school-mistresses, and pupil teachers.
They hold examinations and grant certificates to
those who prove their efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>


<p class="sub"><i>Education by Correspondence.</i>&mdash;For the special
benefit of ladies living in the country who may wish
to prepare for the public examinations, arrangements
have been made by several of the lecturers at Cambridge
for giving instruction by correspondence in
some of the subjects of study selected by the University
of Cambridge for the examination of women.
Information on this point will be given by Mrs. Peile,
Trumpington, Cambridge. Correspondence classes
have also been organised by Miss Shaw, Poyle Orchard,
Burnham, Maidenhead, to whom application for
admission must be made. The classes are conducted by
ladies, who are authorised to receive as pupils those
whom the Cambridge lecturers are unable to accept.
Should they find that the number of these fall short
of the number they are able to instruct, they will
receive others, whether in direct preparation for the
examination or not.</p>

<p>The instruction is given by means of:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Papers of questions set from time to time,
and the answers looked over and returned with
comments.</p>

<p>II. Solutions of difficulties and general directions
as to books.</p>

<p>III. Short essays or <i>résumés</i> written by the
pupils, and sent for correction to the teachers; or,
in the language-classes, passages set for translation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>The papers will, if possible, be returned to the
students not later than a week from their reception,
and another set of questions sent at the same time.
The fee is £3 3s. the course for each subject, paid in
advance. The course extends over the three Cambridge
terms&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from October 14th to the end of May.</p>

<p>For an account of other educational advantages open
to women I refer my readers to the "List of Colleges,
Schools, Lectures, &amp;c.," published by the Women's
Education Union; and the "Educational Year Book,"
published by Cassell &amp; Company, Limited.</p>

<p>A great boon to ladies anxious to qualify themselves
for governesses, and who have not the necessary
means, is the Teachers' Education Loan Society, which
advances school fees upon certain conditions to persons
over sixteen desirous of improving their education
for purposes of self-maintenance as teachers.
Apply for regulations by letter to the Hon. Secretary,
Miss Ewart, 3, Morpeth Terrace, Victoria Street,
London, S.W., before February, May, and November
in each year, for the three terms of Easter, Michaelmas,
and Lent following.</p>


<h3>SALARIES OF MISTRESSES.</h3>

<p>The Rugby Council for Promoting the Education
of Women has instituted a calendar, giving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
names and addresses of ladies who have passed the
university examinations, and who desire educational
work of any kind; it also contains full particulars
respecting all the university examinations. Many
ladies whose names are entered in this calendar have
succeeded in obtaining good situations through it,
with salaries varying from £50 to £150 a year. A
fee of 2s. 6d. is charged, in addition to an entrance
fee of 2s. 6d. to ladies on each situation obtained
through the calendar; its price is 1s. Communications
may be addressed to Mrs. Kitchener, School
House, Newcastle, Staffordshire.</p>

<p>Miss Buss, of the North London Collegiate School,
has published a list of girls' schools, with special
regard to salaries of head mistresses (as recommended
by the Endowed Schools Commission), which I quote
to show what good incomes are attainable in the
profession of teaching. Applications for engagements
as assistant mistresses should in all cases be made first
to the head mistress of the school.</p>

<p>Ladies desirous of becoming head mistresses must
send in their applications to the Secretary of the
Company, 21, Queen Anne's Gate, S.W. Every application
must be in writing, and be accompanied by
original testimonials (which will be returned). Candidates,
whose age must be stated, should have had
experience in school management, and must produce
testimony to their power of organisation, and ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to maintain firm but kindly discipline, as well as to
their attainments and capacity as teachers of classes.</p>

<p>Subject to bye-laws, regulations of the Council, and
to an annual examination and inspection of the school
by independent examiners, each head mistress will
have the management of the studies and discipline of
the school, and will be consulted in the selection and
appointment of all assistant teachers, whose emoluments
will be settled by the Council.</p>

<p>The emoluments of the head mistress will consist
in each case of a fixed stipend of £250 per annum,
together with a capitation fee of £1 10s. for every
pupil in the school above the number of 100 up to
200, and of £2 for every pupil above the number of
200 up to 300.</p>

<p>There will be no residences attached to the schools;
the head mistresses will not be allowed to take boarders
or instruct private pupils except with the express permission
of the Council, and the school year will be
divided into three terms, each about thirteen weeks in
length, and the engagement of each head mistress will
be entered into subject to its being terminable either
by the Council or by her at the end of a term and
after the expiration of one term's previous notice. It
is particularly requested that candidates abstain from
canvassing members of the Council, either directly or
indirectly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Ladies desirous of becoming teachers in the schools
of the Company, are requested to observe the following
regulations:&mdash;</p>

<p>All appointments of assistant teachers are made by
the Council, usually on the recommendation of the
Committee of Education.</p>

<p>Candidates and their testimonials are in the first
instance referred to the head mistress of the school
concerned, who examines the testimonials and makes
inquiry as to the qualifications when necessary at
personal interviews. The head mistress then lays the
several testimonials before the Education Committee,
with a report upon them. The Education Committee
make such further inquiries and hold such interviews
with any of the candidates as they may deem fit, and
then submit candidates for the approval of the Council.
The Council pay second-class railway fare for those
candidates with whom a personal interview is desired.</p>

<p>All appointments of assistant teachers are made on
probation for the first two terms, that is to say are
terminable by the head mistress at the end of the
first or second term without reference to the Council,
and without more than a month's notice.</p>

<p>When the Council have approved an appointment
after the probationary period, an assistant teacher is
required to sign an agreement with the Council, and
is removable by the Council after notice of at least two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
months, expiring at the end of a school term. The
same notice is required from an assistant teacher. At
the end of the probationary period assistant teachers
are placed on the permanent staff at a rate of salary
depending upon their work and qualifications. These
salaries begin at amounts varying from £70 to £135
per annum, and rise annually for four years by increments
varying from £7 to £15. Junior teachers and
paid student teachers are not included in the above.
Board and residence are not provided by the Council.</p>

<p>The qualifications required vary with each special
case. A knowledge of English grammar and literature,
arithmetic, and one or more languages besides
English, together with some experience in teaching,
are usual requisites. Ability to assist in the instruction
in drawing is also desirable. Music is always
taught by special teachers.</p>

<p>It is a great recommendation if candidates have
passed in the Higher Oxford or Cambridge Examinations,
the London University Examinations, or other
examinations of the like kind.</p>

<p>All applications should be made by letter, stating
age, qualifications, and experience, and accompanied
by copies of testimonials (not originals). These documents
should be addressed to the head mistress of the
particular school, at the school; or if not for any
special school may be marked "Application for Assis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>tant
Teachership," and directed to the Secretary of
the Company, 112, Brompton Road, London, who
will send them to any head mistress needing an
assistant.</p>

<p>Applications to teach special subjects, such as
music, harmony, class-singing and pianoforte, drawing,
higher Latin, French, or German, mathematics,
any branch of natural science, drill, &amp;c., should be
made in the same manner.</p>

<p>Inquiries as to vacancies are best made of the
various head mistresses early in the months of April,
July, and December; they may also be addressed to
the Secretary of the Company.</p>


<h3>ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>Teachers in the elementary schools receive good
salaries, have short hours of work, and are comparatively
in an independent position; but I have no
doubt many ladies would find the class of children
they would be required to teach a great trial to them,
as the habits and ideas of children of the lower classes
would, in all probability, prove a considerable shock
to the sensibilities of ladies who came in contact
with them for the first time. The elementary schools
employ an immense number of teachers. In the
schools under the School Board alone 2,500 certificated
female teachers are employed, besides a large number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of pupil-teachers. The teachers under the School
Board all receive good salaries, but as the whole
scheme of payment is now under revision, it is
impossible to give exact figures. Pupil-teachers
begin at 4s. a week. There are seven weeks' holiday
in the year; the hours of work are from 9 to 12,
and 2 till 4.30. The head mistress is expected
to give an hour's extra instruction to the pupil-teachers.</p>

<p>These are the regulations for admission of teachers
to all public elementary schools&mdash;that is to say, all
schools in receipt of a grant from the Education
Department, including National, British, Wesleyan,
Roman Catholic, and Board Schools.</p>

<p>The recognised classes of teachers are: Certificated
teachers, pupil teachers, and assistant teachers.</p>

<p>Teachers in order to obtain certificates must be
examined, and must undergo probation by actual
service in school.</p>

<p>The examination for certificates is open to:&mdash;(<i>a.</i>)
Students who have resided for at least one year in
training colleges under inspection; or (<i>b.</i>) candidates
who are upwards of twenty-one years of age. (1.)
Completed an engagement as pupil-teacher satisfactorily;
or (2.) obtained a favourable report from an
inspector; or (3.) served as assistants for at least six
months in schools under certificated teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>Candidates who at the time of the examination
are not teachers of schools to which annual grants
are or may be made, must be recommended by the
authorities of their college, or by the managers of
the school in which they last served.</p>

<p>Candidates for certificates, after successfully passing
their examination, must, as teachers continuously
engaged in the same schools, obtain two favourable
reports from an inspector, with an interval of one
year between them; and if the first of these reports
be not preceded by service of three months (at the
least) since the examination a third report, at an
interval of one year after the second report, is issued;
if the second (or third) report is favourable a certificate
is issued.</p>

<p>Teachers under probation must satisfy the conditions
which require that schools be kept by certificated
teachers.</p>

<p>Pupil-teachers must be not less than fourteen
years (completed) at the date of their engagement.</p>

<p>They are required to pass an easy examination,
and produce certificates of health and character.</p>

<p>At the close of their engagement pupil-teachers
are perfectly free in the choice of employment. If
they wish to continue in the work of education they
may become assistants in elementary schools; or may
be examined for admission into a training college;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
or may be provisionally certificated for immediate
service in charge of small schools.</p>

<p><i>Assistant Teachers.</i>&mdash;Pupil-teachers who have completed
their engagements with credit, and passed their
examinations satisfactorily, and candidates not having
been pupil-teachers who have passed with success
the examination for entrance into a training college,
may serve as assistants in schools, in place of pupil-teachers,
without being required to be annually examined.</p>


<h3>TRAINING COLLEGES.</h3>

<p>An examination for Queen's Scholarships is
annually held at each college in summer, and at
special local centres, commencing at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> on the
first Wednesday after July 2nd.</p>

<p>The candidates are selected and admitted to the
examination by the authorities of each college on their
own responsibility, subject to no other conditions on
the part of the Education Department than that the
candidates:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Intend <i>bonâ fide</i> to adopt and follow the profession
of a teacher in elementary schools.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) If pupil-teachers have successfully completed
their engagement, or will do so before the following
examination for admission.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Not having been pupil-teachers, will be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
than eighteen years of age on January 1st next
following the date of examination.</p>

<p>The successful candidates are arranged in three
classes in order of merit.</p>

<p>A place in the third class qualifies for employment
as an assistant teacher, but not for admission into a
training college or for a provisional certificate.</p>

<p>The authorities of each college settle their own
terms for admission.</p>

<p>Candidates are required to pass a medical examination.</p>

<p>The following is a list of training colleges for
mistresses. It must be stated that the entrance fee
entitles the student to board, lodging, washing, and
medical attendance for two years, except during the
holidays:&mdash;</p>

<h3>GOVERNESSES IN PRIVATE FAMILIES.</h3>

<p>After having said so much about the necessity of
training, examinations, &amp;c., I think it only fair to
make some mention of governesses in private families
for the younger children, under fourteen. Many
parents are wise enough to prefer for these posts a
thoroughly conscientious lady, even if she is not
accomplished, to one who has any number of certificates,
unless she combines with them a due sense
of the importance of her task.</p>

<p>Ladies whose circumstances induce them to seek a
situation in some one else's house should, above all
things, avoid undue sensitiveness, and the habit of
attributing unkind motives (which probably never
exist) to every little incident which may occur. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
course a governess's life is not likely to be the happiest
one could imagine, but I think it is usually her own
fault if it is not a contented and useful one, and
perhaps this is as much as it is wise for any of us to
expect.</p>

<p>The best place for governesses of this class to
apply to for situations is the Governesses' Benevolent
Institution, 47, Harley Street, where no fee is
charged. Any governess on procuring and leaving
two satisfactory letters from respectable parties, written
in the first person, signed, sealed, and addressed to
the Board, may enter her name, and such other
particulars as she may wish to state, in the books of
registration, kept for that purpose. There is also a
book to register applications for governesses. The
Board of Management abstain from all interference
between the parties, and the entries must be made by
parties themselves, ladies in the country acting by
a friend. No letter or testimonial can under any
circumstances be returned nor taken from the office.
It is necessary that all letters be written in the first
person. Office hours from 12 to 5.</p>

<small>ARTISTIC EMPLOYMENTS.</small></h2>


<p class="sub"><i>Schools of Art.</i>&mdash;A knowledge of drawing is required
in so many of the employments open to women that
I think it advisable to give some information as to
how it can best be acquired.</p>

<p>In connection with the National Art Training
School at South Kensington, Metropolitan District
Schools of Art are established at the following places:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>1. The Female School of Art, 43, Queen Square, Bloomsbury.</li>
<li>2. Blackheath, Lee, and Lewisham (Bennett Park).</li>
<li>3. Blackheath Hill, 13, Lansdowne Place.</li>
<li>4. Chelsea, Onslow College.</li>
<li>6. Chiswick, Bath Road, Bedford Park.</li>
<li>6. Holloway (Camden School).</li>
<li>7. Hornsey.</li>
<li>8. Islington, Barnsbury Hall.</li>
<li>9. Lambeth, Miller's Lane, Upper Kennington Lane.</li>
<li>10. North London, Sandringham Road, Kingsland.</li>
<li>11. St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Castle Street, Long Acre.</li>
<li>12. St. Thomas Charterhouse, Goswell Road.</li>
<li>13. Stoke Newington.</li>
<li>14. Stratford, Maryland Point.</li>
<li>15. West London, 155, Great Titchfield Street.</li>
<li>16. Westminster, Royal Architectural Museum.</li>
</ul>


<p>I give the rules of the South Kensington School;
the others differ slightly, but further particulars can
always be obtained by application to the head masters;
as a rule the expense of studying at the local schools
is less than at South Kensington, but the same system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of instruction is pursued. The second grade certificate,
so often mentioned in these pages, is by no means
difficult to obtain. As will be seen by the rules, it is
necessary to pass the examination for it before joining
the art classes.</p>

<p>There is a large number of free studentships; for
particulars of these application must be made to the
Secretary, Science and Art Department, S.W.</p>

<p>The South Kensington rules are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The courses of instruction pursued in the
school have for their object the systematic training of
teachers, male and female, in the practice of Art, and
in the knowledge of its scientific principles, with a
view to qualifying them as teachers of Schools of Art
competent to develop the application of art to the
common uses of life, and to the requirements of trade
and manufactures. The instruction comprehends the
following subjects:&mdash;Freehand, architectural, and
mechanical drawing; practical geometry and perspective;
painting in oil, tempera, and water colours;
modelling, moulding, and casting. The classes for
drawing, painting, and modelling, include architectural
and other ornament, flowers, objects of still life, &amp;c.,
the figure from the antique and the life, and the study
of anatomy as applicable to art.</p>

<p>II. These courses of instruction are open to the
public on payment of fees. These are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>
<div class="small">
<p class="center"><i>Fees for Classes studying five whole days, including evenings</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">£5 for five months, and an entrance fee of 10s.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Evening Classes.</i></p>

<p class="center">
Male School,&nbsp; &nbsp; £2 per term.<br />
Female School, £1 per term, three evenings a week.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The classes for male and female students meet
separately.</p>

<p>Governesses in private schools or families may
attend the day classes for not more than three months,
on payment of £1 per month, without payment of the
entrance fee.</p>

<p>III. No students can be admitted to these classes
until they have passed an examination in freehand
drawing of the second grade. Examinations of candidates
for admission will be held weekly at the commencement
of each term, and at frequent intervals
throughout the year. These examinations are held at
the school on Tuesdays at 10.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> and 6.45 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
Candidates should bring their own lead pencils and
indiarubber. Unsuccessful candidates cannot be re-examined
until after a month's interval. The examination
fee is 2s. 6d. for day students, and 6d. for
evening students, to be paid at the time of examination.</p>

<p>IV. The annual session consists of two terms,
each lasting five months, and commencing on the 1st
of March and the 1st of October, and ending on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
last day of July and the last day of February respectively.
One week at Christmas and one week at
Easter or Whitsuntide are also vacations. The school
is open every week-day except Saturday. Hours of
study are&mdash;day, 9 to 3.30; evening, 7 to 9. Evening
classes for females on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Fridays.</p>

<p>Classes for modelling have been lately formed at
the Lambeth Technical School of Art, 122, Kennington
Park Road. Practice in modelling from drapery, the
antique, and the human figure nude and draped. On
Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings, from
7 to 9.30. Fee, 5s. per month.</p>

<p>Modelling from casts of ornaments:&mdash;The practice
will be adapted to the technical wants of the individual
students. This class meets on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings, from 6.30 to 9. Fee, 2s. 6d. per
month.</p>

<p>There is an annual examination for prizes in all
schools of art, and a national competition.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Royal Academy.</i>&mdash;Free instruction is given for a
period of seven years at the Royal Academy of Arts,
Burlington House, to any one who shows sufficient
talent. Applicants for admission must have attained a
certain proficiency, and must deliver specimens of their
work, with a printed form duly filled in, at the Academy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
on or before the 28th of June, or the 28th of December,
to be submitted to the Council. This form can
be obtained from the Registrar through the written
request of a member, or some artist or person of
known respectability.</p>

<p>The hours of work are from 10 to 3. Students
are required to provide their own materials.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Designers.</i>&mdash;There is a great demand for skilful
and original designers, but only for really clever ones,
as so much of the ordinary work is done by pupils.
Mr. Sparkes, the head master of the South Kensington
School of Art, tells me any one with natural taste
and invention can be trained thoroughly in designing,
including a knowledge of the human figure, in two
years, if willing to work hard; after that time it would
be necessary to give some months to become acquainted
with the possibilities of the material to be designed
for, such as glass, table-linen, cretonnes, dress materials,
wall papers, &amp;c. After a few months' study,
I should advise pupils to ask their head master's
candid opinion as to their chances of success, as he
would be better able to tell them than any one else.</p>

<p>Many of the large manufacturers employ designers
permanently, at salaries not lower than £100 a year,
and in many cases the work can be done at home.
The authorities at South Kensington have frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
applications for designers, and recommend the most
deserving amongst the students. Before offering
designs to manufacturers it is advisable to ascertain
what style they require, as sometimes a prejudice is
created by unsuitable work being offered, which is
never overcome. Many of the large upholsterers
employ girls to design furniture. It requires a good
knowledge of drawing, including perspective, but not
so much talent as other kinds of designing. The
salaries vary from 25s. to 30s. a week.</p>

<p>At the Lambeth Technical School of Art, 124,
Kennington Park Road, classes for the study of design
meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings.
The course is adapted for the use of all students engaged
in the practice of ornamental art, and is specially
designed for the use of those occupied in pottery
painting and surface decoration. The fee is 2s. 6d.
per month, except to those students who have already
joined the Art School, who will pay 6d. additional fee.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Wood Carving.</i>&mdash;A school of art for wood carving
has recently been established at the Albert Hall,
South Kensington, where ladies can receive the
thorough training which is essential to their success
in this branch of art labour. Three years is
the least time in which a fair knowledge of the art
can be acquired by capable and industrious students,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
but at the end of the first year those who are clever
may earn as much as ten or twelve shillings a week;
when proficient, their earnings would probably be
from £2 to £3 weekly, though in cases of exceptional
talent, no doubt, considerably more might be occasionally
earned.</p>

<p>There are very few highly skilled wood carvers
in England, so there would be no difficulty in disposing
of really good artistic work. The best plan for
those unable to obtain permanent employment is to
make small articles, such as blotting-books, photograph
frames, glove-boxes, paper-knives, &amp;c., take
them to the large fancy shops, and offer them for sale.
Upholsterers and picture-frame makers give regular
employment to many; and when that can be obtained
it is doubtless more satisfactory than anything else.</p>

<p>The rules of the school at the Albert Hall are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Both day and evening classes are held in the
school. The day classes are held from 10 to 1 and
2 to 5 on five days a week, and from 10 to 1 on
Saturdays. The evening classes are held from 7 to
9 on four evenings a week, viz., Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, and Friday. The fees for day students
are £2 a month, or £5 a quarter. The fees for
evening students are 15s. a month, or £2 a quarter.</p>

<p>There are at present twelve free studentships,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
viz., six in the day and six in the evening classes.
Candidates must have passed the second grade art
examination of the Science and Art Department in
freehand drawing at least. Those who have some
knowledge of wood carving, or have passed in the
other subjects of the second grade art certificate,
or in drawing from the antique and the figure,
architectural drawing, or designing and modelling,
will be preferred. Applications for these studentships
should be addressed to the Secretary, at the
school.</p>

<p>All students are required to provide their own
tools, and work done in the schools by free students
cannot be taken away. Students paying their own
fees may take away work executed by themselves on
their own materials, but all work on materials provided
by the school remains the property of the
school. Students who have been in the school not
less than twelve months may, on the recommendation
of the instructor, receive such payment for their work
as the Committee may determine.</p>

<p>The tools students are required to provide themselves
with, during the whole time they attend the
school, cost about £2, but for 15s. they can procure
enough to carry them over the first few months. The
free studentships are for periods of six months, and
are renewed to promising students. A taste for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
designing, and a considerable knowledge of drawing,
are so desirable that I cannot conscientiously recommend
any one without them to adopt wood carving
as her profession, for although a certain degree of
mechanical excellence might be obtained, it would
not be sufficient to ensure a livelihood.</p>

<p>Mr. Donaldson, a member of the firm of Messrs.
Gillow and Co., Oxford Street, takes a very great
interest in the school, and kindly allows me to say
that he intends to do all in his power to give
employment to ladies competent to undertake it; but,
of course, as the work required by his firm is of a
superior kind, those anxious to obtain it must study
until they can produce excellent work.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Wood Engraving.</i>&mdash;To learn the art of wood-engraving
thoroughly a long apprenticeship is absolutely
necessary. All authorities agree in saying
that students must not expect to earn anything at
all for the first three years; after that time they
may probably earn £1 a week, but should still continue
their course of study for two years at least.
There is not the slightest reason why women should
not rival men in this branch of art, if they will give
the necessary time to acquire it.</p>

<p>The work can very frequently be done at home,
which is usually considered an advantage; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that case ladies must make up their minds to work
as steadily and for as many hours a day as they
would under the eyes of a master; for certainly only
those who could be depended upon for punctuality
would be likely to obtain remunerative work.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the five years, when the pupil
may be expected to have become a skilled engraver,
her earnings would be from £1 10s. to £4 or more
a week, according to her industry and ability.</p>

<p>The City and Guilds of London Institute has
established a technical class of wood engraving at
122 and 124, Kennington Park Road, under the
care of Mr. C. Roberts.</p>

<p>The hours of practice are from 10 to 4, and from
6 to 8 in the evening, daily, except Saturday; and
all students are expected to attend regularly and
punctually.</p>

<p>On Tuesday and Friday evenings the work of the
class will be examined. At all other times students
will be responsible to an assistant teacher, or senior
student, who will be always present.</p>

<p>All members of the class must have taken the
second grade certificate of the Science and Art Department,
or must be prepared to do so.</p>

<p>Four scholarships, each consisting of a free studentship
for one year, will be awarded annually after the
first year's practice. These may be renewed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
following year on proof of industry and progress, and
on the recommendation of the master. The fee will
be £3 3s. a year, payable by half-yearly sums of
£1 11s. 6d. in advance. No student can be admitted
for a shorter period than one year.</p>

<p>The vacations are six weeks in the summer two
weeks at Christmas, and two at Easter or at Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>The cost of the tools each student is required to
provide herself with is 22s.</p>

<p>For those students who at the expiration of two or
three years are sufficiently advanced in their practice to
be able to execute work for publication, Mr. Roberts
has, with the co-operation of the Society for the Employment
of Women, established a work-room in connection
with his own offices at Lonsdale Chambers,
Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>At this work-room all those advanced students that
Mr. Roberts is able to accommodate and employ will
continue to have his supervision, and receive work,
and be advanced according to their ability.</p>

<p>Mr. Paterson, an engraver, who has been a
most successful teacher for fourteen years in both
Edinburgh and London, holds a class for ladies
every Monday and Thursday, from 2 to 3 o'clock,
at 3, East Temple Chambers, Whitefriars Street. No
pupil will be received for less than two quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>As his is a private class, he of course cannot
compete in price with the one under the patronage
of the City and Guilds of London Institute. His
terms are:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left">Engraving</td>
  <td align="center">£2</td>

  <td align="center">3</td>
  <td align="left">0 <span class="gap2">"</span></td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>A small charge is also made for the wood used by
the pupil; it never exceeds 7s. 6d. a quarter. The
cost of the tools is 21s., but they are highly finished
and ready for use. Many of Mr. Paterson's pupils
are now earning considerable incomes. A knowledge
of drawing, though very desirable, is not essential,
especially as in all probability no one who was entirely
devoid of the artistic faculty would care to
attempt to become an engraver, as it is doubtless a
long and arduous task, though the success which
may be attained would, when it came, be, I think, a
full recompense for all the time and trouble that had
been expended.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>China Painting.</i>&mdash;Painting on china has been considerably
overdone of late years, and now only really
good work can be at all certain of finding a market.
The best way for amateurs to dispose of their work
is to send it to Messrs. Howell and James's annual
exhibition, as they allow each exhibitor to send three
small or two large pieces of work, and last season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
£3,000 worth of ladies' paintings on china were sold.
Each piece of work should be marked the price at
which it is to be disposed of, a commission of 15 per
cent. being charged on the published price of all
works sold, to defray the expenses of advertisement
and exhibition. Only strictly original works are
eligible for prizes, but adaptation and copies are not
inadmissible for exhibition if approved by the judges,
to whom all works are submitted. All works must be
sent in by the end of March.</p>

<p>Before taking lessons in painting on china, it is
essential that ladies should have a good knowledge
of drawing. With that, a few months' lessons will
make them proficient china painters; without it, they
will never do anything worth buying. Classes for
pottery painting are held at Messrs. Howell and
James's, Regent Street, every day excepting Saturdays.
Terms:&mdash;The course of ten lessons of two hours
each, £3 3s.; six lessons, £2; three lessons, £1 1s.</p>

<p>Messrs. Doulton and Co., Lambeth, employ about
120 ladies permanently in painting on china. The
work is paid by the piece, so the amount earned
depends on the workers. A class for pottery painting
is formed on Tuesday and Friday at the Lambeth
School of Art, Miller's Lane, Upper Kennington
Lane; fee, 10s. 6d. per month. I believe this class
was formed at Messrs. Doulton's request principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to prepare ladies to execute their work, as they found
teaching ladies who had no previous knowledge of
the art took up too much of their time. The head
master of the Lambeth School of Art told me he
thought it useless for ladies to join the class who
had not a considerable knowledge of drawing, such,
for instance, as they might acquire by two years'
study at some school of art.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Painting on Leather.</i>&mdash;This branch of decorative
art is well suited to women, but there is but a small
demand for it. Some of the large upholsterers are
willing to employ ladies, but they must have a good
knowledge of drawing, and be willing to give two
years to learn the technicalities of the art, and to
gain experience of the different styles, especially
Spanish and Italian, at the South Kensington Museum
and other places. At the expiration of that
time wages would begin at from 6s. to £1 a week,
according to ability; and the probable eventual earnings
would be from £2 to £3 weekly.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Mosaic.</i>&mdash;Women have frequently been employed
in manufacturing mosaic; but it is so little used in
England that at present I can hear of no place where
they would be likely to obtain work. But when
the decoration of St. Paul's Cathedral in mosaic is
commenced&mdash;if it is entrusted to an English firm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
as I sincerely hope it will be&mdash;there will be employment
for hundreds of women for some years. The
usual pay mosaic workers obtain if they have no
knowledge of drawing is about £40 a year; if they
can undertake the more difficult parts, such as the
human figure, their salaries are proportionately higher.
The mere technical knowledge is easily acquired in
a month.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Painting on Glass.</i>&mdash;It is a great pity ladies are
not more extensively employed in painting on glass.
Messrs. Powell and Co., of the Whitefriars Glass
Works Company, Whitefriars Street, employ a few.
These ladies work in a separate room, six hours a
day, and four on Saturdays; these are obviously very
short hours, and Mr. Powell has no objection to increase
them if he finds the ladies he employs are
willing; of course their work is paid by time. He
intends to increase his staff of lady workers as occasion
arises. Only a very slight knowledge of drawing
is required for the lower branches of this art, and it
is necessary to give perhaps three months, certainly
not more, to acquire it. The average earnings are
from £60 to £70 a year; any one capable of copying
figures and painting them on glass would obtain a
higher salary, probably £100 a year.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Decorative Work.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Simpson and Co. em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>ploy
a large number of ladies in various kinds of
decorative work, such as painting tiles, glass, decorating
enamelled iron, &amp;c., at salaries beginning at
£40 a year, and rising according to the value of
their services. The hours of work are from 9 to 6,
with the usual interval of an hour.</p>

<p>A good knowledge of drawing is required, such
as might be obtained by two years' hard work at a
School of Art, and it is desirable that the human
figure should have been carefully studied; but Messrs.
Simpson and Co. prefer that the ladies who come
to them should be without any special knowledge of
the work they will be employed in, as they would
rather impart it themselves.</p>

<p>Miss Collingridge, 9, Beaumont Street, Portland
Place, N.W., undertakes all kinds of art decorative
work, and receives pupils; the hours of study are
from 9.30 to 4 o'clock. Many of her pupils have
been very successful in obtaining engagements as
designers, china painters, &amp;c., and two are now employed
in drawing for costumiers. To obtain constant
work at the conclusion of a course of study,
Miss Collingridge thinks versatile invention and refined
feeling essential, as is also business capacity.</p>

<p>The Misses Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were in business
as house decorators, cabinet-makers, and designers
of all the details of household furniture and uphol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>stery,
at 2, Gower Street (corner of Bedford Square),
London, and I understand they were very successful.
They attributed their success entirely to the thorough
training they went through, and their strict attention
to business. Miss Rhoda Garrett has unfortunately
lately died, but Miss Agnes Garrett still carries on
the business. Miss Garrett takes pupils or apprentices
for a not shorter time than three years, at a premium
of £300. The hours of work are from 10 to 4.
After the apprenticeship industrious ladies of ordinary
intelligence would be prepared to start in business on
their own account, but for this capital is of course
required. If two sisters or friends went through
the course of study together, and into partnership
afterwards, as the Misses Garrett did, they would
be much more likely to succeed than one would
alone.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Plan Tracing.</i>&mdash;It has been thought that women
might very well be employed in tracing the plans
of builders, architects, and engineers, and an office for
the purpose has been established, through the agency
of the Society for the Employment of Women, at
8, Great Queen Street, S.W. It is going on very satisfactorily;
several ladies are employed; they give three
months to learn the work, and after that time their
pay commences at threepence an hour, rising to six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>pence;
they work seven hours a day. Ladies who wish
to learn the work, without desiring employment, can
be received on payment of a premium of £10; but
it is requested that all inquiries should be addressed
to Miss King, Secretary to the Society for the Employment
of Women, 22, Berners Street, Oxford
Street.</p>

<p>I think many of the large firms might be induced
to employ women permanently in copying their plans,
if personal application were made to them and specimens
of work taken. The great requisites for success
in this work are neatness and accuracy; the merely
technical knowledge is easily acquired.</p>

<p>Although they do not actually teach plan-tracing
at the schools of art, their architectural classes would
be found to give most of the necessary information,
sufficient to enable a careful student to apply for work
with the full consciousness of being able to do it.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Photography.</i>&mdash;The following particulars respecting
the employment of ladies in photography have been
kindly given me by Mr. Elliott, of the firm of
Elliott and Fry, photographers, Baker Street, London.
He requested me to warn ladies against wasting
their time in learning to tint photographs, as the
fashion for these has almost entirely died out, and he
has innumerable applications from ladies anxious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
tint them. A considerable number of women are
employed by the trade in spotting photographs; their
wages usually begin at 6s. a week, rising, when they
have learnt their business, which can easily be done in
two months, to 15s. or £1. The hours of work are
from 9 to 5. Many are employed in mounting
photographs on cards; it is work that requires great
neatness and accuracy; the pay varies from £1 to
£1 5s. a week.</p>

<p>Re-touching negatives is the most difficult and
consequently the best-paid branch of photography
open to women; it requires some knowledge of drawing,
and, Mr. Elliott says, considerable common sense;
a few lessons in the technicalities should be taken from
some re-toucher before applying for work, a month
would be quite long enough to acquire them, and the
fee would probably be small. A re-toucher willing to
give the necessary instruction could usually be heard
of at the leading photographers'. The salaries vary
from 30s. to £3 a week.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Art Needlework.</i>&mdash;The Royal School of Art Needlework
in the Exhibition Road, South Kensington, is
by far the best of all the work societies, and the only
one where ladies who are once admitted can be certain
of constant employment; so it is the only one of
which I shall give a description. These are the rules:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>I. Application for admission as qualified workers
for the school must be made to the Manager by the
applicants in person, and they must give two references
to prove their position.</p>

<p>II. Applicants must fulfil the following requirements:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) They must be gentlewomen by birth and
education.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) They must be able and willing when employed
to devote seven hours a day to work at the school.</p>

<p>III. Every applicant is required to go through a
course of instruction, for which £5 is charged.</p>

<p>IV. The course of instruction consists of nine
lessons in art needlework, of five hours each. If
after the first two lessons, in the opinion of the
teacher, the applicant is not likely to be successful as
a needle worker, she will be recommended to retire,
and on so retiring the £5 will be returned to her.</p>

<p>V. The school enters into no engagement to give
employment to any lady.</p>

<p>This last rule is practically not carried out, as
ladies are never allowed to take the preliminary
lessons unless there are vacancies for qualified
workers.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give the probable earnings, as all
work is paid by the piece; but I have been able to
gather that the average earnings are from 20s. to 30s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
a week. This sum is practically only exceeded by
very quick and clever workers.</p>

<p>During the holidays given by the school, ladies are
allowed to take work home, so their incomes are only
limited by their own industry, or perhaps I should
say lack of it. About 120 ladies are employed, and I
understand there are a considerable number of candidates
for each vacancy as it occurs.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Painting on Silk and Cards.</i>&mdash;All the paintings on
silk, satin, or cards, for fans, valentines, scent packets,
and Christmas cards, sold by Mr. Rimmel, 36, Strand,
and at his various branch establishments, are executed
by ladies and gentlemen at their own homes. The
paintings must be of a superior character, and not mere
repetitions, as anything original is sure to sell. Some
of the ladies who paint regularly for him earn as much
as £3 or £4 a week. I have no doubt many other
firms employ ladies in the same way.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Medical Drawings.</i>&mdash;Doctors frequently require
careful drawings of different diseases, and ladies who
are good draughtsmen are usually employed to make
them. Application should be made at the different
hospitals, and specimen drawings taken. It would be
good practice to make copies of the drawings of
diseases to be found in medical works. I understand
ladies are now making as much as £2 to £3 a week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
in this way. Of course the demand is somewhat
fluctuating.</p>

<p><i>Tapestry Painting</i> consists of painting with
specially-prepared liquid colours on a woven textile
fabric. Messrs. Howell and James sell all the necessary
materials, and classes for instruction are held at their
Art Studio, 5, Regent Street. Terms:&mdash;The course of
ten lessons of two hours each, £5; the course of six
lessons of two hours each, £3 3s.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<small>MEDICINE AS A PROFESSION FOR WOMEN</small></h2>


<p>Ladies wishing to enter the medical profession can
receive the necessary instruction at the London
School of Medicine for Women, 30, Henrietta Street,
Brunswick Square. It is desirable that they should
have private means, as, unless they go to India, where
there is a considerable opening for medical women,
it would probably be some time before their practice
would be sufficiently remunerative. Ladies desiring
to prepare for the medical profession must pass one of
the examinations in Arts recognised by the General
Medical Council, such an examination being compulsory
before registration as a medical student.</p>

<p>Among these examinations are:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The Oxford and Cambridge Local Examinations,
Senior and Junior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>II. The Senior Local Examinations for Honorary
Certificates, and the ordinary Local Examination of
the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>III. The Local Examination for Honours Certificates
of the University of St. Andrews.</p>

<p>IV. The Examination in Arts of the Society of
Apothecaries in London.</p>

<p>V. The examinations for a first-class certificate of
the Royal College of Preceptors.</p>

<p>VI. The Local Examinations of the Queen's
University in Ireland.</p>

<p>VII. The Matriculation Examination of the
University of London.</p>

<p>Certificates must in all cases include English
literature, Latin, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and
also one of the following optional subjects:&mdash;</p>

<p>Greek, French, German, or natural philosophy.</p>

<p>Four years is considered the necessary time of
study to obtain a license to practise from the King's
and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland; and the
expense, including examiners' fees, hospital practice,
books, and instruments, is slightly under £200. This,
of course, does not include board and lodging.</p>

<p>An M.D. degree from the University of London
is more difficult to obtain, and necessitates additional
study of a year, or possibly more. There are at
present thirty-six pupils in the school. No one is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
admitted under the age of eighteen. An entrance
scholarship of the value of £30 is competed for annually
in September.</p>

<p>All persons requiring further information on
subjects connected with the medical education of
women, with the residence of students in the neighbourhood
of the school, or respecting scholarships, are
invited to apply to Mrs. Thorne, hon. secretary, 30,
Henrietta Street, Brunswick Square, London.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Pharmaceutical Chemists.</i>&mdash;As the Pharmaceutical
Society has now thrown its examinations open to
women, there is nothing to prevent them from setting
up in business as chemists. It is an occupation peculiarly
adapted to women, and returns a better interest
on invested capital than most other trades.</p>

<p>A preliminary examination in Latin, Arithmetic,
and English, has to be passed, unless the candidate
can produce a certificate of having passed the Local
Examinations of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge,
Durham, or Edinburgh, the Examination of
the College of Preceptors, or those of any legally
constituted examining body previously approved by
the Council, provided Latin and arithmetic be included
in the subjects.</p>

<p>Before going up for the other examinations each
candidate must produce a certified declaration that for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
three years she has been registered and employed as
an apprentice or student, or has otherwise for three
years been practically engaged in the translation and
dispensing of prescriptions.</p>

<p>The cost of passing the three examinations necessary
to become a pharmaceutical chemist, including
tuition, examiner's fees, books, chemicals, apparatus,
&amp;c., is from £80 to £100, and the time required for
study after the apprenticeship would be from a year
to eighteen months.</p>

<p>Miss Isabella S. Clarke, a pharmaceutical chemist,
in Spring Street, Paddington, is willing to take outdoor
apprentices for three years at a premium of £100.</p>

<p>The capital required to start in business with a
reasonable prospect of success is from £500 to
£1,000; the nearer it is to £1,000 the better. The
stores have done much to injure chemists' business by
selling patent medicines, hair-washes, soap, scents,
&amp;c., at much lower prices than private traders can
afford to adopt.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Dispensers.</i>&mdash;I understand that many doctors who
prepare their own medicines are willing to employ
ladies to dispense them, at salaries ranging from £30
to £50. The necessary knowledge can be acquired at
the New Hospital for Women, Marylebone Road,
where they are willing to take girls and teach them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
dispensing for six months for a premium of £5. It
is necessary that candidates should have a slight
knowledge of Latin, and an intimate acquaintance
with arithmetic, especially fractions; and desirable
that they should be of studious habits, as they are
expected to read various books recommended them
by the authorities. Employment can also occasionally
be obtained at hospitals, especially by ladies who can
undertake bookkeeping as well as dispensing.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Hospital Nurses.</i>&mdash;Hospital nursing affords certain
employment to capable women, and, although the
salaries are low, it must be remembered that liberal
board, comfortable bed-rooms, and washing, are always
included. Trained nurses' salaries usually commence
at £20, rising, according to experience and responsibilities,
to £30. Chief nurses of wards, usually called
ward sisters, obtain in the chief London hospitals
from £35 to £50. Matrons and lady superintendents
of nursing receive from £50 to £100. Nearly all the
London hospitals train nurses.</p>

<p>I give the rules of the Nightingale Fund and of
the Westminster Training School, as I believe these
will be found fair specimens of the rest.</p>

<p>At St. Thomas's two classes of probationers are
received. The rules for special probationers are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>The committee of the Nightingale Fund have
made arrangements for the admission to their school
at St. Thomas's Hospital of a limited number of
gentlewomen who may desire to qualify themselves
in the practice of hospital nursing, with the express
object of entering upon this profession permanently,
by eventually filling superior situations in public
hospitals and infirmaries.</p>

<p>These probationers will be required to pay towards
the cost of maintenance during their year of training
the sum of £30, and to give an undertaking to continue
in the work for three years after leaving the
school; but, upon payment of a higher sum of £52,
to cover the cost of maintenance and also partly of
instruction, &amp;c., the undertaking will be limited to
one year after leaving the school.</p>

<p>Occasional vacancies occur for the admission of
gentlewomen free of expense, together with, in some
cases, a small salary during the year of training.
These advantages will be strictly limited to those
whose circumstances require such aid.</p>

<p>Candidates desirous of receiving this course of
training should apply to Mrs. Wardroper, the Matron,
at St. Thomas's Hospital, subject to whose selection
they will be received into the hospital as probationers.
The age considered desirable for these probationers is
from twenty-seven to thirty-seven, single or widows;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
a certificate of age and other information will be
required. Should opportunities occur for affording
instruction in some of the duties of supervision, they
will be expected to remain for that purpose for a
further period of two or three months, but in that
case no further payment will be required. Payment
will be required by two equal instalments in advance,
viz., half on admittance, and half at the end of six
months. No part of the paid instalment will be
returned in the event of the probationer leaving from
any cause.</p>

<p>The probationers will receive instruction from the
medical instructor and the hospital "sisters," and will
serve as assistant nurses in the wards of the hospital.</p>

<p>The names of the probationers will be entered in
a register, in which a record will be kept of their
qualifications. At the end of a year those whom the
Committee find to have passed satisfactorily through
the course of instruction and training will be entered
in the register as certified nurses.</p>

<p>On completion of their training they must be prepared
to take employment on the nursing staff of
some public hospital or infirmary wherever offered to
them by the Committee, and to continue in similar
employment for a period of three years at least, this
period being limited to one year in the case only of
those who have paid at the higher rate. As a step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
to superior situations, they will be expected, if required,
to accept an engagement as nurse (day or
night), at the usual salary, for the whole or a portion
of the first year after leaving the training school.
Engagements, whether as nurse or in a superior situation,
will from time to time, during the above period,
be made through the Committee with the managers of
the institution, by whom the certified probationer is
to be employed. Her salary will be paid to her by
such managers, but it is expected that she will not
terminate any engagement without due notice to the
Committee.</p>

<p>Withdrawal from the service may be allowed upon
special grounds&mdash;family circumstances or otherwise&mdash;to
be approved by the Committee.</p>

<p>Probationers will not be expected to go out of
Great Britain unless at their own request.</p>

<p>The Committee desire, in every case where a staff
of nurses is engaged from the "Nightingale Fund,"
to place at the head of them a superintendent, who
has been also trained in the same school. Applications
have been numerous for trained nurses to fill
superior situations, such as matron, superintendent,
assistants to those officers, and ward sister or chief
nurse, while there has hitherto been a want of qualified
candidates. The Committee therefore anticipate
no difficulty in being able to offer suitable appoint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>ments
to their certified probationers. They will, in
recommending for employment, consult the inclination
of every probationer&mdash;so far as a due regard to the
special circumstances of each case enable them to do.</p>

<p>Every probationer will be required, at the end of
one month from the date of entry into the hospital,
to sign a written engagement, agreeing to abide by
these regulations.</p>

<p>These are the rules for the ordinary training of
hospital nurses:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Committee of the "Nightingale Fund" have
made arrangements with the authorities of St.
Thomas's Hospital for giving a year's training to
women desirous of working as hospital nurses.
Women desirous of receiving this course of training
should apply to Mrs. Wardroper, the matron at
St. Thomas's Hospital, subject to whose selection they
will be received into the hospital as probationers.
The age considered desirable for probationers is from
twenty-five to thirty-five single or widows; a certificate
of age and other information will be required.
They will receive, during the year of training,
payment in money and clothing to the value of £16,
on the following footing, thus:&mdash;Clothing, costing
about £4; payment at the end of the first quarter,
£2; at the end of the second quarter, £2 10s.; at
the end of the third quarter, £2 10s.; at the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the fourth quarter, £8; and a further gratuity of £2
if recommended for employment. Should the term
of residence be extended beyond the year, payment
will be made at the end of the fifth quarter of £4.</p>

<p>At the close of a year their training will usually
be considered complete, and during the three years
succeeding the completion of their training they will
be required to enter into service as hospital nurses,
in such situations as may from time to time be offered
to them by the Committee.</p>

<p>The names of the probationers will be entered in
a register, in which a record will be kept of their
conduct and qualifications. This will be submitted at
the end of every month to the Committee of the
"Nightingale Fund." At the end of a year, those
whom the Committee find to have passed satisfactorily
through the course of instruction and training,
will be entered in the register as certified nurses, and
will be recommended for employment accordingly.
The Committee have hitherto readily found employment
for their certified nurses in some public hospital
or infirmary, at salaries usually commencing at £20,
with board (including tea and sugar) and washing.
Many have, after some years' service, obtained superior
appointments.</p>

<p>Engagements are not to be made except through
the Committee, and no engagement is to be put an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
end to without a quarter's previous notice to the Committee.</p>

<p>The Committee will allow a yearly gratuity of £2
to all their certified nurses, to be paid at the end of
every complete year of service, succeeding the term
of training, up to the third year, inclusive, providing
that evidence be given at the end of each year that
the nurse has served the whole time satisfactorily.</p>

<p>No gratuity will be paid if the Committee have
reason to suppose that the nurse intends to discontinue
her employment. At the expiration of one month
from the date of entry, every probationer will be required
to write a letter to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>To the Chairman of the Committee of the "Nightingale Fund."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having now become practically acquainted with the
duties required of a hospital nurse, I am satisfied that I shall
be able and willing, on the completion of my year's training,
to enter into service in a public hospital or infirmary, and I
engage, in accordance with the annexed regulations of the
"Nightingale Fund"&mdash;in return for the advantages bestowed
upon me&mdash;to continue in such service for the space of at least
three years, in whatever situations the Committee shall think
suitable to my abilities, it being my intention from henceforth
to devote myself to hospital employment. I further agree not
to enter into any engagements except through the Committee,
and not to leave any situation without giving due notice to the
Committee.</p>

<p>
I am, Sir, &amp;c., &amp;c.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following regulations are common to both
classes of probationers:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>The term of the probationers' training is a complete
year. Probationers will be received on the
distinct understanding that they will remain for the
required term; they may, however, be allowed to withdraw
upon grounds to be approved by the Committee.
They will be subject to be discharged at any time
by the matron in case of misconduct, or should she
consider them inefficient or negligent of their duties.</p>

<p>The probationers will be under the authority of
the matron of the hospital, and will be subject to
the rules of the hospital. They will be lodged in
the hospital in the "Nightingale Home," which adjoins
the matron's house; each will have a separate
bed-room, and they will be supplied at the cost of the
"Nightingale Fund" with board, including tea and
sugar, and a weekly allowance of 1s. 6d. for washing;
and with a certain quantity of outer clothing of a
uniform character, which they will always be required
to wear when in the hospital.</p>

<p>The usual times of admission are the quarter days.
Candidates must be seen by Mrs. Wardroper, at St.
Thomas's Hospital, Albert Embankment, Westminster
Bridge, London, between 10 and 12 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> only, on
Tuesday or Friday. These regulations may be obtained
by writing to H. Bonham-Carter, Esq., Secretary
to the "Nightingale Fund," 91, Gloucester Terrace,
Hyde Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>The regulations of the Training School for Nurses
in connection with Westminster Hospital are very
similar, but I think it better to give them in detail.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Westminster School for
Nurses has made arrangements for training their probationers
in a practical way in the wards of the above
hospital. Those young women who are desirous to
be so trained should apply (personally, if possible, or
else by letter) to the lady superintendent of the
Training School, 8, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster.
It is desirable that the ages of candidates should be
between twenty-five and thirty-five. Testimonials of
health and character, according to forms supplied by
the lady superintendent, will be required; and when
satisfactory, and as vacancies occur, the applicants
will be received as probationers.</p>

<p>Probationers will be under the direction and
authority of the lady superintendent and the rules
of the training school; and whilst at work in the
hospital they must obey and recognise all the standing
rules of that institution. Probationers will be
supplied with board, lodging, and washing.</p>

<p>If retained, the wages in the first year of a probationer
will be £16, of which a portion may be
retained till the completion of her year of probation,
as guarantee of her good behaviour, and subject to
forfeiture in case of misconduct. Probationers will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
be required to conform to any regulations in regard
to uniformity in outer clothing, and if supplied with
materials for the same by the school, the cost (not
exceeding £4 4s.) will be retained from their wages.</p>

<p>It is expected that at the end of a year probationers
will be fitted to be nurses, and their engagement
will require them to serve two years more in
hospital or private nursing, with an increase of £2
for each year&mdash;that is, £18 for the second, and £20
for the third.</p>

<p>At the expiration of one month from the date of
entry every probationer will be required, in such
form as may be in use, to engage herself to continue
in the service for at least two years longer than her
probation, after which her time will be her own. In
the event of her not continuing after the first month
no wages will be paid.</p>

<p>The names of the probationers will be entered on
a register, in which a record will be kept of their
conduct and qualifications. At the end of every
quarter the record will be submitted to the Committee
of Management.</p>

<p>The probationers will be subject to be discharged
at any time by the lady superintendent in case of
misconduct, or should she think them inefficient or
negligent in their duties.</p>

<p>The nurse, or probationer, must not only be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
to read written instructions, and to write, but have
had a good English education. The probationer or
nurse is to keep her own room neat, clean, and in
order, in the home, as well as to assist in the needlework
there if required to do so.</p>

<p>The duties of the nurses will be to attend both
the rich and the poor, either in hospitals or private
houses.</p>

<p>The lady superintendent tells me that nearly half
the ladies who come to her leave at the expiration
of the trial month, having discovered that they
are unsuited to the life, although I believe it is
not particularly trying.</p>

<small>CLERKS.</small></h2>


<p class="sub"><i>Bookkeepers.</i>&mdash;There is a very considerable demand
for female clerks and bookkeepers. The necessary
knowledge is easily acquired by any industrious person
with punctual and orderly habits.</p>

<p>An adult bookkeeping class is held at 22, Berners
Street, Oxford Street, the office of the Society for
the Employment of Women. On entering the class
a student is required to bring recommendations from
two householders, who will be responsible for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
thorough steadiness and respectability. If, as is often
the case, the student has lately left school, a letter
from the mistress, or her latest school report, is
required, and those only are admitted to the class
who can write clearly and neatly, spell correctly,
and work accurately the first four rules of arithmetic
simple and compound. A course of lessons generally
extends over four or five months; during that time
students are not only taught the principles of book-keeping
by single and double entry, but every effort
is made to inspire them with a high sense of responsibility,
and to make them punctual, orderly, and
earnest, in the discharge of their duties. No student
is allowed to go up for examination unless her conduct
in the class has been satisfactory, and unless she
has shown a desire to do her work conscientiously.</p>

<p>Bookkeepers who have gained certificates almost
invariably retain their situations with credit. It is
often difficult to obtain a first situation, for practical
experience is generally required, but in this the certificate
is a great help, as it forms a good introduction,
and is a guarantee of efficiency and respectability.</p>

<p>When she has once made a fair start, a certificated
bookkeeper is seldom unemployed. The class meets
on the evenings of Monday and Thursday, at 6.30.
The fee is sixpence weekly. A bookkeeping class is
also held at the College for Working Women, 7,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square. The fee is 1s. 3d.
each term; there are four terms in the year, consisting
of 35 lessons, from 8 to 9.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> New pupils are only
admitted on the first class night of the Michaelmas
and Easter terms. Students can be examined by the
Society of Arts, and obtain the certificates of the
Society free of expense. The membership fee is a
shilling a term extra.</p>

<p>Public classes, besides those I have mentioned,
are held at the College for Men and Women, Queen
Square, Bloomsbury; at the Quebec Institute, Baker
Street; and at the Birkbeck Institute, Chancery
Lane. Clerks must be prepared to accept low salaries
for their first engagements, perhaps 10s. a week; but
after they have gained experience, they will be able
to secure from 15s. to 30s. a week.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Telephone.</i>&mdash;The United Telephone Company, 36,
Coleman Street, Moorgate Street, employ about a
hundred young ladies, chiefly the daughters of professional
men who have received few educational
advantages, and no special technical instruction.
The requirements being small the salary is in proportion,
commencing at 11s. weekly, and rising slowly
to 16s. Candidates must be between the ages of
16 and 20. Those whose parents are in trade are not
eligible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>


<p class="sub"><i>Shorthand Writing.</i>&mdash;The power of writing in
shorthand is a very valuable acquisition, especially to
bookkeepers who also act as correspondents, as it
frequently enables them to obtain larger salaries than
they could expect without it, and there is an increasing
demand for female shorthand clerks. Translators
also occasionally employ them to write from dictation,
and sometimes it happens they can get work as
reporters.</p>

<p>Miss Pritchard, of 83, Edgeware Road, is highly
recommended as a teacher. She says it requires
nine months to learn, and perhaps from six to
twelve months' practice afterwards, to become a proficient
writer, so much depends upon the individual
ability. She herself began to earn money by it at
the end of the first nine months. Her charge for
tuition is a guinea for thirteen lessons, one every
week. She can usually arrange to give the lessons,
if desirable, in the evening, so that they need not
interfere with any daily employment in which her
pupils may be engaged.</p>

<p>The rate of pay shorthand writers expect to receive
is twopence a folio (72 words). Of course for this they
have to make a fair copy of their work in ordinary
writing.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan School of Shorthand in Chancery
Lane undertakes to ensure proficiency for a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
fixed charge. I understand that the sum of £5 is
the maximum amount.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Post Office Directories.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Kelly and Co., of
51, Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn, employ a considerable
number of female clerks to assist in compiling
their Post Office directories; they will take girls from
the age of fourteen, and the only necessary qualifications
are reading and perfectly legible writing. The
pay commences at 8s. a week, and increases 2s. a
week every year until it reaches a pound. The hours
are from half-past nine until half-past five, excepting
on Saturdays, when they leave off working at four
o'clock. An hour is allowed for dinner, which must be
eaten on the premises. The duties are decidedly easy,
and the hours light. Applications for employment
must be made by letter, but vacancies seldom occur.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Junior Army and Navy Stores.</i>&mdash;These recently-established
stores employ ladies as clerks; the preference
is given to daughters of military or naval officers.</p>

<p>The necessary qualifications are a thorough knowledge
of arithmetic, a slight acquaintance with book-keeping,
and good legible writing. The hours are from
nine to six, with an hour's interval for dinner. The
salaries commence at £40 a year.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Prudential Life Assurance.</i>&mdash;One hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
sixty ladies are employed by this Company at their
offices, Holborn Bars; only daughters of professional
men are eligible, and they require no special
qualifications beyond an ordinary English education.
The hours of work are from a quarter to ten to
five o'clock; on Saturdays until two. The comfort
of the lady clerks has been studied to a very great
extent, an excellent library and piano are provided
for their use, and a refreshment room, where
they can obtain luncheon (for which an hour is
allowed) at a moderate price. The flat roof has been
converted into terraces, where they may take exercise
during their luncheon hour, and they have a separate
entrance and staircase to that used by the male
clerks.</p>

<p>They are paid £32 the first year, £42 the second,
and £52 the third; after that time their salaries increase
according to the value of their services. The
duties principally consist of copying and writing
letters from notes.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Coupon Sorters.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Rothschild, St.
Swithin's Lane, and Messrs. Baring, Bishopsgate
Street Within, employ a small number of
women in sorting coupons; the only necessary
qualifications are an ordinary English education
and good references. At Messrs. Baring's the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
hours of work are from ten to five. The junior clerks
receive 15s. a week, and the seniors' salaries average
£1 to 25s.; they are engaged by the week. I believe
that Messrs. Rothschild's rules are very similar.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Law Copyists.</i>&mdash;Many women are now employed
in law copying; they are apprenticed for six months,
sometimes paying a small premium of 2 or 3 guineas,
but in some cases they are only required to give their
time. After six months they begin to earn a few
shillings a week, which may increase, according to
efficiency, to 25s. Their salary is regular, and does
not depend (as it does in the case of men) on their
employers having work or not. The hours are from
nine to seven, excepting on Saturdays, when they
leave a little earlier.</p>

<p>The following firms employ women, but only the
first three will teach:&mdash;Mr. Hardy, Castle Street,
Holborn; Mrs. Le Fuel, Brownlow Street, Holborn;
Mr. F. Watkins, Dyer's Buildings, Holborn; Messrs.
Hooper and Sons, Ludgate Hill; Messrs. Hadley, Castle
Street, Holborn. Law clerks also occasionally employ
women as copyists, and I think efficient writers might
frequently obtain private employment from solicitors,
especially if they had any acquaintance with them, or
they could take specimens of their work to strangers,
and boldly ask for a trial. Employers like girls to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
begin to learn soon after leaving school; they will take
them as young as fifteen.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Telegraphy.</i>&mdash;The following is an exact copy of the
rules for telegraph clerks. Applications for admission
to the Telegraph Office must be made to the Postmaster-General,
as all nominations are made by him.</p>

<p>The subjects for test examination are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Writing from dictation.</p>

<p>(2.) Writing with a pencil, or style.</p>

<p>(3.) Arithmetic (easy sums in the first four rules).</p>

<p>Limits of age, not under fourteen or above
eighteen.</p>

<p>Successful candidates have to attend the Post Office
Telegraph School to undergo a course of instruction in
telegraphy, for which instruction no charge is made,
but they do not receive any pay while at the school.</p>

<p>The course of instruction usually extends over a
period of three months, but if at any period of their
tuition, or during their probationary employment at a
telegraph office, it becomes evident they display no
aptitude for the duties of a telegraphist, their nomination
or probationary appointment will be cancelled.</p>

<p>The scale of pay for women is 8s. per week, on
receiving a certificate from the school, and commencing
the period of probation; rising to 12s. on being
certified to be fully capable of transmitting public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
messages; and rising to 14s. on being certified as
being capable of taking charge of a telegraph instrument;
afterwards, as vacancies occur, 14s. per week,
increasing by 1s. per week to 17s. per week, with a
prospect of rising to 30s. per week.</p>

<p>Hours of attendance for female clerks, eight hours
a day, between the hours of 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> and 8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>


<p class="sub"><i>Post Office Clerks.</i>&mdash;A considerable number of
ladies are employed in the Receiver and Accountant
General's Office; it is, I believe, more generally known
as the Post Office Clearing House. An entrance
examination has to be passed in the following subjects
of competitive examination, conducted by the Civil
Service Commissioners:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Handwriting and orthography.</p>

<p>(2.) English grammar and composition.</p>

<p>(3.) Arithmetic (including vulgar and decimal
fractions).</p>

<p>(4.) Geography.</p>

<p>Candidates under seventeen or above twenty years
of age are ineligible.</p>

<p>Hitherto women have been employed as returners
and counterwomen in the General Post Office, London,
but no fresh appointments have been made for some
time, and it does not appear likely that there will be
any more.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<small>MISCELLANEOUS.</small></h2>


<p class="sub"><i>Assistants in Shops.</i>&mdash;I do not think it is generally
known how valid the claim of the girls employed by
the large linendrapers is to the much-disputed title of
"young lady." At all the houses where I have inquired,
I find that a large proportion of the girls are
daughters of professional men, the fathers of the
remainder being for the most part farmers and clerks;
they are all fairly well educated, possess good manners,
and if their conduct is not above reproach they are
immediately dismissed.</p>

<p>I give particulars of five representative houses.
I think the rules of others of the same class will be
found very similar. All the particulars have been
furnished me by members of the firms, and in many
cases I have also made inquiries of the young ladies
who are employed. Their universal opinion is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
they are much better off than they would be if they
were governesses; in fact, many of them have been
governesses, and have given it up from the difficulty
of obtaining comfortable engagements. Their evenings
are entirely at their own disposal, and they are
allowed to go away from Saturday until Sunday night
or Monday morning, if their employers know where
they are going. At very nearly all the shops I
mention the girls are allowed to sit down excepting
when they are engaged in serving. The good feeling
existing between employers and employed seems to be
very general.</p>

<p>I heard no complaints from either side; the heads
of the firms all seemed to think they could not do too
much for the comfort of their employés, and they on
their side seemed fully sensible of the kindness with
which they are treated. Their sitting and bed rooms
are all spacious and airy, and their food, which on
two occasions I had opportunities of inspecting, plentiful
and good.</p>

<p>All the firms employ large numbers of women
who do not live in the house, but I shall not give any
particulars respecting them, as they are of quite a
different class to those I am writing for.</p>

<p>Messrs. Howell and James, Regent Street, employ
twenty-five ladies in their establishment, who live
in the house. When their contemplated alterations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and improvements are made, each young lady will
have a separate bed-room; they have very pleasant
sitting-rooms, and a library and piano are provided for
their use.</p>

<p>The hours of work are from 9 to 6, Saturdays
until two, and they all have a fortnight or three
weeks' holiday in the summer. The salaries vary
from £20 to £200 a year. Apprentices are received
for three years; they live in the house, and pay a
premium of £40. Improvers are also taken. All
applicants must have good references and manners,
and be well educated.</p>

<p>Messrs. Lewis and Allenby, Regent Street, employ
seventy ladies in the house, twenty-four in the show-rooms,
and the rest in the workrooms. They take
neither apprentices nor improvers, and all the young
ladies who apply to them must previously have received
a thorough training. Hours of work are from
8.30 until 6.30, Saturdays until 2. They have three
weeks' holiday after the London season. Their house
has lately been rebuilt, and the rooms are everything
that can be desired; two young ladies usually share a
bed-room. A piano, and house library, besides a
subscription to Mudie's, are provided for the use of
the young people.</p>

<p>The salaries range from £25 to £200 per annum.
A doctor calls every day to see any one who may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
ill, and anything he orders is immediately provided at
the expense of the firm.</p>

<p>Messrs. Marshall and Snelgrove, Oxford Street
and Vere Street, employ seventy ladies in their
show-rooms. The hours of work are from 8.30 until
6.30 in the winter, or 7 in the summer; Saturdays
until 2. Sixteen days' holidays are allowed after the
season. No apprentices are received, and the salaries
vary from £20 to £150 a year. About ninety or a
hundred girls are also employed in their work-rooms,
at salaries of from £15 to £100 a year.</p>

<p>Messrs. Venables, High Street, Whitechapel, a
very old-established firm, employ twenty-five in the
house, at salaries of from £20 to £200 per annum.
The hours of work are from 9 till 7 in winter, until
7.30 or 8 in summer, Saturdays until 3 o'clock. A
fortnight's holiday is given every year. Apprentices
are taken for two or three years at a small premium,
which is usually returned as a bonus for good conduct.
There is a bagatelle and a billiard table, a piano, and
a library of 2,000 volumes, for the use of the employés.
Not more than four girls are ever expected
to share the same room.</p>

<p>Messrs. Spencer, Turner, and Boldero, Lisson
Grove, employ seventy ladies. The working
hours are from 8.30 until 7, and they have a fortnight
or three weeks' holiday in the year. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
salaries are from £5 to £100 a year. Apprentices are
received for two years without a premium, and their
friends are only required to provide them with clothes.
In one large room five young ladies sleep, but as a rule
there are not more than three or four in a room.</p>

<p>Only the young ladies in the show-rooms are
allowed to sit down; it would interfere too much
with business if those behind the counters were provided
with seats. I asked two of them if they found
the continual standing affect their health; they said
girls for the first month found it very trying, but
after that they become used to it, and, excepting in
very hot weather, did not mind it at all. Cases of
serious illness are very rare in all the establishments
I have visited. At the last two shops I have mentioned
the class of customers is very different from
the others; but, with that exception, I believe the
young ladies employed are equally comfortable.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Teachers of Cookery.</i>&mdash;At the National Training
School for Cookery in the Exhibition Road, South
Kensington, ladies are taught to be efficient teachers
of cookery, and, as a rule, do not find it difficult to
obtain engagements. The School Board employs a
considerable number, and pays them at the rate of
£60 a year.</p>

<p>Teachers of cookery can now pass through a full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
course of twenty weeks' training in cookery and
practice in teaching at the National Training School
for Cookery, South Kensington. The fee is £20.
Teachers of plain cookery only can now pass through
a course lasting ten weeks; the fee is £8 8s.</p>

<p>Students in training are expected to attend evening
classes, held by staff teachers, once a week. A
student in training for a teacher first passes as a
pupil through the Scullery and Demonstration Classes.
This takes (working every day except Saturday)
one month, from 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, with an interval
from 12 to 2 for rest and luncheon. At the end of
the month her note-books are to be examined and
corrected. She then spends one month learning in
the Plain Cookery Practice Kitchen, and a fortnight
in teaching there what she has already learnt. She
next goes into the High Class Practice Kitchen, and
spends one month in learning and a fortnight in
teaching. The last month is devoted to practice in
demonstrating, first a fortnight in private, and lastly
a fortnight in public, for which the lady superintendent
has drawn up careful and strict rules; they are
hung up close to where the student stands, to give
her demonstration.</p>

<p>During her course of training the student can, if
she likes, dine with the other pupils for 1s., or, if that
is beyond her means, she is allowed to purchase any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
little dish that has been cooked as a lesson, at a
nominal charge.</p>

<p>The staff teachers receive £75 per annum and
their dinner at the school while employed in
London. When sent to reside out of London
they receive a further sum of 20s. a week for board
and lodging, and all their travelling expenses; one
months' notice on either side to terminate the engagement.
When the staff teachers are all employed a
few extra teachers are taken on as improvers at £1
a week, as this fits them to fill good appointments in
the provinces when they offer. These engagements are
terminable by a week's notice on either side.</p>

<p>The work of a teacher on the staff varies somewhat
according to the nature of her appointment&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
if employed in the school itself she will have to
be in her kitchen by 9.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to see that her kitchen-maid
has everything in proper order for the pupils
to begin work at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> The lessons end at 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>
The teacher would, in most cases, be able to leave
the school at 5 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>

<p>If a staff teacher is sent to the provinces, the
hours of work in that case depend greatly upon the
local committee who for the time being employ her,
but the number of hours of work are limited to
twenty-four in the week, to be distributed by arrangement
with the local committee and the teacher. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
nominated for training, the candidate must not be
under eighteen nor exceed thirty-five years of age.
She will be admitted either by payment of fees or by
subscriber's nomination. She must be sufficiently
educated to be able to perform the duties of an instructor
after the special training.</p>

<p>The diplomas of teachers are of two classes.
Students, according to the class of diploma they have
obtained, will be recommended to the public desirous
to employ teachers, preference being given to teachers
in the highest class.</p>

<p>The conditions of admission are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That the student agrees to obey all the rules
of the school laid down by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That for any infraction of the rules the student
may be discharged at a day's notice, without having
a claim of any kind upon the school.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That if after training the student proves competent
(of which the Committee are sole judges), and
her services be required, she will be prepared to
accept an engagement on the staff of the school, at a
salary ranging from £1 to £2 weekly; but it is to
be clearly understood that the Committee are not
responsible for finding any paid employment for the
student while in the school, or afterwards, the employment
of teachers certified by the school resting
wholly with the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>Teachers, while on the staff, and employed in the
school, are not free to take any engagement without
leave from the Committee, given in writing. Teachers
holding diplomas not on the staff are free to make any
engagement for teaching they may think fit, and may
refer to the lady superintendent, who will give additional
information as to their qualifications when
required to do so.</p>

<p>Any subscriber to the school of £1 1s. has a right
to a vote, and twenty votes admit a candidate to a
full course of training, so that to become a subscriber
is an excellent opportunity to be charitable, and oblige,
possibly, a friend at the same time.</p>

<p>I think if, in addition to teaching cookery, ladies
were able also to lecture on the elements of physiology
and the laws of health, they would more readily
find engagements, and be able to command better
salaries. Unfortunately, at present there is no place
where they can be examined as to their capabilities,
and receive certificates, which would be most desirable.
They can, however, acquire the necessary information by
reading and attending some of the excellent courses of
lectures on the subject that are frequently held in London;
they are generally advertised in the daily papers.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Music.</i>&mdash;No lady should take up music as a profession
unless she has sufficient talent to justify her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
in expecting to be a first-rate teacher and performer.
The profession is overstocked to a most painful extent
already with second-rate teachers, and, speaking
roughly, I should say there are very nearly as many
people anxious to teach music as there are people to
be taught. In the one branch of class-singing, I
believe there is a large demand for good lady teachers,
as they are most difficult to obtain, and any really
competent persons may be sure of obtaining engagements
at good salaries. For any one with exceptional
talent a thorough training is the great
thing to be desired, and this can be obtained at
the Royal College of Music, Kensington Gore, where
a free musical education, in all its branches, is
given for five years, to any one who can obtain a
scholarship. Many of these are open to public competition,
without any limit of age. The school does
not provide board or lodging, though I believe some
of the scholarships carry with them exhibitions for
maintenance. The year is divided into three terms,
and there are twelve weeks of vacation. Students,
when competent, are allowed to give lessons or perform
in public during their spare time. No engagements are
guaranteed at the end of the course of study; but the
authorities do all in their power to secure them. For
further information respecting the scholarships, &amp;c., application
should be made to the registrar at the school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p><i>Royal Academy of Music</i>, Tenterden Street,
Hanover Square.&mdash;At this Academy, also, pupils are
thoroughly trained in music.</p>

<p>Students are admitted at the commencement of
each term and half-term. Candidates for admission
must attend for examination, bringing music they can
perform, at eleven o'clock on the Saturday before each
term or half-term, with a recommendation from a
subscriber, a member, an associate, or an honorary
member.</p>

<p>The fee for examination is £1 1s., which is returned
on the admission of the candidate. Candidates
residing at a distance from London may be primarily
examined by any one of the local examiners, from
whom they may obtain information and advice respecting
the Academy. One or more local examiners
(whose services are honorary) are appointed in every
principal town of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The year is divided into three terms, and there are
thirteen weeks of vacation.</p>

<p>The annual fee for the entire course of study is 30
guineas, or 10 guineas per term, with an entrance fee
of 5 guineas.</p>

<p>The course of instruction includes two weekly
lessons in a principal study, one in harmony, one in a
second study, when deemed desirable, one in elocution
for singers, and the advantages of the sight-singing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
class and violin quartet class, and the orchestral and
choral practices.</p>

<p>All payments must be made in advance. On
leaving the Academy students may undergo an examination.
Should the examination prove satisfactory
they will receive a certificate, and in special cases the
additional distinction of being made an associate of
the institution.</p>

<p>There are a great many free scholarships attached
to this institution; inquiries about them should be
directed to the secretary at the Academy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The London Academy of Music</i>, St. George's Hall,
Langham Place, Regent Street, is designed for vocal
and instrumental students, amateur and professional,
desirous of receiving a complete musical education in
this country from the best London professors on the
moderate fees of the Continental institutions.</p>

<p>Students can select either harmony, pianoforte
playing, singing, or any other branch of the art, as
their principal study, and receive individual instruction
in that branch from one of the principal professors;
they will in addition receive instruction in
two other branches.</p>

<p>The year is divided into three terms, each term
consisting of twelve weeks' instruction. A lesson is
given once a week in each branch of study, students<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
residing at a distance can receive all their lessons on
one day. The fee for each student is 5 guineas per
term. This includes a whole course of instruction
necessary for a complete musical education. French,
German, Italian, elocution, and deportment, are all
extras. The fee for each is £1 1s. per term. A fee
of £3 3s. is charged for students desirous of attending
the operatic class and the drawing and painting class.</p>

<p>All fees are required to be paid in advance. Candidates
for admission as students must show that they
possess sufficient ability to profit by the course of
study, and are required to attend at the Academy
before the commencement of the term at which they
desire to be admitted in order to be examined by the
principal. The examination fee is 5s. There are
several scholarships; these entitle their holders to
one year's free instruction, or to two years' instruction
by paying half fees each term.</p>

<p>Further particulars can be obtained at the office,
St. George's Hall.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Printing.</i>&mdash;A women's printing office has been
established at 21<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span>, Great College Street, Westminster,
where only female apprentices are taken. In answer
to my questions, the girls said they liked the work
much, and found it very interesting; it is necessary
that they should read and spell well, and have some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
knowledge of punctuation. The apprenticeships are
for three years, and the premium is £2, which is returned
in wages, as they commence after the first
month, at the rate of 2s. 6d. per week, rising to 10s.
by the end of the three years; after that time the
amount earned depends upon the worker's industry
and quickness; the average earnings are from £1 to
£1 10s. a week. The hours of work are from 9 till 6.30,
with an hour's interval for dinner; all the workers,
including apprentices, are paid extra for overtime.</p>

<p>Several other printers employ women, but when
men are employed as well the women are not usually
paid at the same rate, and the premium in most cases
is £5. Messrs. Bale, of 87 and 89, Great Titchfield
Street, have taken girl apprentices for many years,
and Mr. Bowden, of Red Lion Street, has done the
same. Miss Emily Faithfull was the first to introduce
printing as an occupation for women in England, and
has employed them for some time at her Victoria
Press, in Praed Street, Paddington.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Dressmaking.</i>&mdash;A lady, trading under the name of
Grace and Co., has recently started a business at
Albany House, 259, Vauxhall Bridge Road, S.W.,
with the following avowed objects:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. To provide work for ladies who do not desire
charity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>II. To afford ladies the means of thoroughly
qualifying themselves in cutting, fitting, and making-up
dresses of every description</p>

<p>III. To give employment to those who have become
qualified in work-rooms, in their own homes, and
in the houses of those willing to treat them as ladies.</p>

<p>IV. To aid those who may be considered competent
in opening branch establishments.</p>

<p>V. To assist those who are qualified and desirous
of emigrating in finding suitable colonial engagements.
Workers will be required to give satisfactory references.
They must be good needlewomen, and forward
a sample, which will not be returned. The object
of this undertaking is to provide remunerative employment
for those requiring it; so all those employed
are expected to conform heartily to the rules which
are essential to success in business. One of the
partners can always be found at Albany House, and
will be pleased to see any one interested in the work.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Plain Needlework.</i>&mdash;Classes for ladies are held at
7, Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy Square Each course consists
of ten lessons in plain needlework and cutting
out in alternate lessons, according to the German
method of teaching in schools. Tickets for one course,
£1 1s.; to ladies who take more than one course a
reduction of 5s. will be made for each additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
course. Tickets are not transferable. Each lesson
lasts an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Ladies anxious to start in business for themselves,
or to obtain situations as overlookers of workers in
wholesale houses, are frequently at a loss to know
where they can obtain the necessary knowledge. The
firm of Hamilton and Co., co-operative shirtmakers,
27, Mortimer Street, London, is willing to take young
ladies to train in business habits and a knowledge
of what is expected from forewomen of workers,
for a year, at a premium of £5, to be returned in
instalments after the first six months. The knowledge
of what work really is, and the punctual habits
that might be acquired in that time, would prove
very valuable to any one wishing to engage in business
on their own account.</p>

<p>At many of the large City warehouses ladies could,
if they liked, be employed in the work-rooms as
machinists, plain-needleworkers, feather-dressers, and
to make up artificial flowers and lace goods. In the
last-mentioned occupations their taste would be a
great advantage. The only objection to ladies being
employed is the class of girls they would have to
associate with; but of course they need have no
acquaintance with them outside the work-room. The
work is usually paid for by the piece, and the earnings
of tolerably quick workers are from 14s. to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
18s. a week. The hours of work are from 9 to 7,
with an hour's interval for dinner, half an hour for
tea, and a quarter of an hour for luncheon.</p>

<p>The plain needlework can in many cases, if the
worker likes, be done at home. Apprenticeships are
necessary for some kinds of the work required, but
no premium is charged, the girl is only expected
to give her time for a few months. This may be
difficult at first, but in the end it is always an
advantage; the skilled workers can always be tolerably
certain of getting employment.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>School Board Visitors.</i>&mdash;A few ladies are employed
by the School Board to go to the children's
homes and to make inquiries as to the cause of
their absence from school; they are paid from £60
to £75 a year. The duties are frequently very
unpleasant indeed, as their visits are considered an
intrusion, and are often deeply resented by the
parents; but as no special qualifications are required,
I dare say many ladies would be glad to obtain the
situations. Application should be made to the Secretary,
School Board Office, Victoria Embankment,
London.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Minor Food Productions.</i>&mdash;A Ladies' Association
has been recently formed for the promotion of horticulture and of
minor food production. They are anxious to establish a college for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
ladies where theoretic and practical instruction would be given, and
scientific training in horticulture and arboriculture, poultry-raising,
dairy work, bee-keeping, etc. To carry out this plan a freehold farm is
necessary, together with sufficient funds to secure a well-organised
system of instruction. It is believed by the promoters of this scheme
that country life may be made healthy, interesting, and profitable, by
a wise application of intelligence and capital; and that by so doing
many openings to beneficial and healthy occupations may be found for
women of the higher and lower classes, both at home and in the colonies.</p>

<p>Many millions of money are annually paid by Great Britain to foreign
countries for various articles of food, a large part of which could be
equally well raised at home, if the best methods of their production
were more widely known and acted upon.</p>

<p>This association is still quite in its infancy, but a committee has
been formed to act as a means of communication between ladies desiring
instruction in the various branches of minor food production and
ladies and gentlemen competent to give the necessary teaching. Letters
addressed to the Honorary Secretaries, Miss Thorn or Miss May Thorn,
Southover Grange, Lewes, Sussex, will receive attention. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
these ladies have already tested the scheme themselves, and found
poultry and pig keeping decidedly remunerative.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Machine Knitters.</i>&mdash;A great many girls are employed in working
knitting-machines. They have to give a short time to learn how to
manage the machine, and then their earnings are from 10s. to 15s. a
week. The hours of work are generally eight a day, but these vary with
the season. This trade is not overstocked.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Hairdressing.</i>&mdash;This is a very suitable occupation for women, and
it is a great pity they are not more extensively employed. Messrs.
Truefitt and Douglas are still the only two large firms where girls are
employed in dressing ladies' hair. Mr. H. P. Truefitt, 13, Old Bond
Street, tells me he always trains the young women in his own workshops,
and that a moderately apt girl is ready to take her turn in the
hair-dressing saloon in six or nine months. Their average earnings are
from 32s. to 35s. weekly. Hours of work are from 9.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to
6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Mr. Douglas's (also of Bond Street) rules are almost
the same. The last set of girls Mr. Truefitt trained were ladies, and
he found the intelligence they brought to bear on their profession and
the difference in their address to ladies much appreciated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>


<p class="sub"><i>Perfumery.</i>&mdash;Mr. Eugene Rimmel, 96, Strand, employs
60 young women in making-up valentines, scent-packets,
&amp;c., and in gumming labels on to bottles, packing
violet powder, bottles of scent, and in various other
ways. Their wages begin at 8s. a week and rise to
21s. The work is quite light and easy. The hours
are from 8 to 1, and 2 to 7.30. The young ladies
he employs to serve in his shops have rather higher
salaries. They begin at 10s. a week, and rise to £2.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Stationery Work.</i>&mdash;Most of the wholesale stationers
employ large numbers of women. The firm that
kindly furnished me with the following particulars
employs 100. They go as apprentices for two years,
paying a premium of a guinea, and they receive in
wages, for the first six months, 1s. a week; during
the second, 2s. 6d.; the third, 5s.; during the fourth,
and last six months, 7s. 6d. a week. After that
time their wages vary from 10s. to 15s. a week.
They are employed in book folding and sewing, stamping
paper, and in various other ways. The hours of
work are from 8.30 to 7; Saturdays until 1.30. An
hour is allowed them for dinner, and two short intervals
of from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
for luncheon and tea.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Superintendents in Laundries.</i>&mdash;It is desired to
employ ladies as superintendents of laundries. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
work is not at all disagreeable, as, of course, they are
not expected to do any of the washing; only they
must have a thorough knowledge of how it should
be done, including the proper amount of soap, starch,
&amp;c., to use. The salaries are about £80 a year, as
well as board and lodging. Application should be
made to some of the large laundry companies.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Artificial Flower Making.</i>&mdash;Large numbers of
women are employed in this trade. They should
begin very young, immediately they leave school, and
it is a great advantage to them if their fingers happen
to be pointed. A large West End firm where I made
inquiries employs 60 or 70 women. The hours of
work are from 9 till 8, with an hour and a half's interval
for refreshment; on Saturdays they cease working
at 2. The wages vary from 14s. to 22s. a week. To
learn the business it is usual to give a few months; no
premium is expected. The large City houses, I believe,
pay by the piece. Making common flowers is
very unhealthy work.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Feather Making.</i>&mdash;Girls are not generally apprenticed
to this trade, but begin to learn it when they
are very young. Their wages commence at 2s. or
2s. 6d. a week, rising eventually to 15s. or £1. The
hours of work are from 9 to 7, out of which time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
half an hour is allowed for dinner, and half an hour
for tea.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Jewellery.</i>&mdash;Women are employed in most manufacturing
jewellers' as polishers. They are apprenticed
for two years without a premium, but during
that time they receive no wages. Afterwards they
are paid from 5d. to 8d. an hour, according to their
skill. The hours of work are usually nine a day,
from 8.30 to 1, and from 2 to 6.30.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Jewel Case Makers.</i>&mdash;The apprenticeship for lining
jewel cases is generally four years without premium.
The first year the girls receive no salary; the second,
3s. a week; the third, 5s.; and the fourth year, 8s.
weekly. The average wages after that time are from
18s. to 30s. a week, and work is very regular and
certain, although the trade is small. For covering
cases the apprenticeship is three years. Wages
begin after the first six months, at 3s., rising until
during the last six months of their time they receive
8s. a week. Their earnings afterwards are from 14s.
to 22s. a week. The hours of work are from 8.30
till 8. Saturdays until 4.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Gold and Silver Burnishing.</i>&mdash;Girls are apprenticed
to this trade generally for three years, sometimes
paying a small premium, sometimes none at all. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
give their services for the first year, and are generally
paid 3s. or 4s. a week the second; and from 8s. to 10s.
the third. After that time their wages are from 14s.
to 18s. a week, but a really good burnisher, if she
could get sufficient gilt-work to do, would make as
much as 25s. a week. The hours of work are from
9 till 8; an hour allowed for dinner, and half an hour
for tea. They are expected to provide their own tools
at a cost of from £3 to £5, but these will last a life-time,
and improve by using.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Dentistry.</i>&mdash;Manufacturing dentists employ girls
in making false teeth. The wages are generally from
15s. to 18s. a week. An apprenticeship of from 18
months to two years is necessary, and the premium
greatly depends upon the position of the dentist.
Some are glad to teach girls simply for their services.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Map Mounting.</i>&mdash;Mounting maps is tolerably easy
work, and requires no special knowledge, only great
care and neatness. Employment can be obtained
from map-shops, and the wages are usually about 15s.
a week.</p>


<p class="sub"><i>Concertina Makers.</i>&mdash;Manufacturers of concertinas
employ girls at about 25s. a week wages. An appren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>ticeship
of a year is necessary. The premium is
£10 10s.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Addresses of manufacturers of all the things I
have mentioned will be found in the Post Office
Directory.</p>

<small>EMIGRATION.</small></h2>


<p>Ladies who have never received any special training,
and have neither time nor means to procure it, would
probably do wisely to emigrate&mdash;that is to say, if
they are domesticated and willing to be generally
useful. In the colonies competition for situations is
not nearly so great as in England, and consequently
governesses, companions, mothers' helps, and housekeepers,
are more valued, and usually treated quite
as members of the family. I give particulars of two
of the Emigration Societies. They gave me most
encouraging accounts of the ladies who had emigrated
under their auspices, and told me they thought any
one, with ordinary good sense, and willing to work,
landing in Australia or New Zealand with a few
pounds in her pocket, would be sure to do well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
They both strongly advise ladies who have friends in
any one of the colonies to choose that one to go to,
as private introductions are most valuable. Intending
emigrants should acquire as thorough a knowledge
of cookery, all kinds of needlework (including dressmaking),
ironing, starching, &amp;c., as they possibly can,
it may prove very useful to them.</p>

<p>The Government of South Australia offers a
free grant of land of the value of £20, to be selected
by the recipient, to any person over the age of
twelve, male or female, paying their own passage
direct to Adelaide, and residing in that colony two
years.</p>

<p>The Queensland Government offers free passages
to people describing themselves as domestic servants.
This does not necessitate their taking that position
on their arrival, but only means they must be willing
to enter domestic service if they can get no better
engagement. The following is a quotation from their
published rules:&mdash;"On arrival in the colony, all passengers,
unless going out under special agreement,
will be at perfect liberty to engage themselves to any
one willing to employ them, and to make their own
bargain for wages." The Queensland Government
Emigration Office is at 32, Charing Cross, London,
S.W., where all information respecting free passages
can be obtained.</p>

<p class="center">RULES.</p>

<p>I. The Society confines its assistance entirely to
educated women, no applicants being accepted who
are not sufficiently educated to undertake the duties
of a nursery governess.</p>

<p>II. Every applicant is examined as far as possible
with regard to her knowledge of cooking, baking,
washing, needlework, and housework; and is required
to be willing to assist in these departments of labour
should it be necessary.</p>

<p>III. Applicants are required to give the names
and addresses of four persons as referees, from whom
the Society may obtain information respecting the
position, character, strength, qualifications, and general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
suitableness of the applicant for a colonial life; two
of these referees to be ladies with whom the applicant
has held situations, and two to be her personal friends.
The references are, if possible, taken up personally
by the secretaries; and the Society hopes, by establishing
correspondents in the chief provincial towns,
to ensure in all cases a personal interview with the
applicant, if not with her referees.</p>

<p>IV. If the information obtained is satisfactory,
the applicant, being accepted by the Society, receives
all possible needful assistance. Should she be unable
to pay the entire cost of cabin fittings and passage
money, the Society advances the deficient amount, a
legal agreement to repay within two years and four
months being signed by the emigrant, and two respectable
householders as securities. Should an approved
applicant not require a loan, she is equally entitled
to the advantages of the Society's care and protection.</p>

<p>V. The Society secures all passages and purchases
cabin-fittings on behalf of the emigrants, thus
saving much trouble and time. It is also enabled,
by the liberality of shipowners and outfitters, to
effect a considerable saving of expense. The cost of
passage and cabin-fittings is generally about £45 first
class, £25 second class. The Society has established
regular correspondents at most of the colonial ports.
As soon as a lady leaves England, notice of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
departure is sent by the overland mail to the correspondent
at the port to which she is bound. Her
name, together with copies of her testimonials, are
sent at the same time; and, as the notice is received
six weeks before the emigrant arrives, there is time
to make preparations for her reception, and even to
seek for situations.</p>

<p>VI. The business of the Society is transacted in
the usual manner by a committee, secretaries, and
treasurers. The selection of emigrants rests with
the secretaries, but the names and testimonials of all
persons sent out may be inspected by the committee.
Cheques are signed by a treasurer and a secretary.
Accounts are audited yearly. Interviews on Tuesdays.</p>

<p>The object of the Society is to promote, by means
of advice and material help, the emigration to the
colonies of respectable Englishwomen of all classes.
The Society inquires into the character, health, and
prospects of success of each intending emigrant, and
watches over her during her transit from her home in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
England to her place of settlement, taking precautions
for her comfort and safety on her voyage, and through
its agents sheltering and protecting her on her arrival at
her destination until she obtains suitable employment.</p>

<p>It obtains and distributes information as to all
the British Colonies, their climate, resources, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Society endeavours to find the necessary
expenses, by loan or gift, for outfit and passage to
women who are of good character but without means.
Many educated or suitable women, struggling unsuccessfully
against the over-competition of the Old
Country, would be glad to emigrate if they were aware
of the existence of a Society able to afford them serviceable
advice and assistance. They cannot go through
the Government Emigration agencies, and are therefore
thrown upon the funds of the Society. To those who
are unable to pay for their passage and equipment,
the assistance of such a Society is indispensable.</p>

<p>The steamers of the P. and O. Company, and of
the Orient Line, perform the passage to Adelaide in
about six weeks. The sailing ships usually occupy
about twelve weeks. The rates of passage vary from
£15 to £75.</p>

truly say it is unlike any other method I have ever known, being easily learned, and
so reliable, the instructions being printed upon the System, and always before the
eye of the cutter. When measures are taken correctly, there is no difficulty in
obtaining a perfect fit the first time. I have cut by your System various garments
for numerous Ladies, and have thus far never failed to produce a perfect fit; among
which I have recently cut a garment for a lady living in a provincial city (without
even seeing her) from measures taken by herself according to your instructions, and
I have since received a letter from her saying that it is the most perfect fit she has
ever had. Therefore I have no hesitation in pronouncing your System perfect in
every respect, and I am now prepared to cut and make garments by your System
for any Ladies who may visit my Establishment. Wishing you every success in
your business,</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
